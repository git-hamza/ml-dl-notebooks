thewineconcierge	US	Wine Club Specialty Membership & Retail	12 October 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I first learned about The Wine Concierge from an event tasting. It was personal and fun and informative. From that tasting I bought 3 wines they had at the tasting from their online store, and I got a discount because I attended the tasting...this was a plus! I loved the wines, so I went to their online store and bought them again. They have wines for retail and a more exclusive selection of wines for their club members. To sign up for membership is free, so I did. They ship quarterly (every 3 months), around the seasons, which works perfect for how I change up my wine choices. They have a basic tier and a premier, higher end wine club tier for membership options, and they provide choices in each. You can take a tasting profile quiz too! It's a plus that you get notified before shipments are to go out, and you have the option to go into your membership and customize your wine selections based on what they offer that quarter. It's really awesome! Membership are charged only for the wines selected at the time they ship, and can be paused or restarted in your profile at any time. I got my shipment in an cool custom box with guides and notes and food pairing suggestions. The wine quality is amazing and having these options with a touch of a button is so convenient. I also get access to their sommelier online which are available to members only with special deals and videos. One thing I really like about them is that in addition to basic online wine retail, they offer the subscription services and the Wine Concierge focus is on small boutique, family owned wineries and the feature women and minority wine makers, owners and producers. For me, its all about personal interaction, knowing I can reach out, but get the ease and convenience at the same price as anywhere else and in some cases, better deals. I can't say enough about how awesome The Wine Concierge is and I love their specialty focus and hands on service.I have told all my friends, and I do get referral discounts!!! -M.S.

vivino	AU	Terrible customer service	13 September 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I ordered 6 bottles of Grant Burge, 4 of the 6 bottles were undrinkable, the bottles fizzed when opened & bubbled up pink in the glass. They had obviously gone off, I notified Vinino customer service & as it was outside the 30 day‚Äôs delivery date, they offered no recourse except for free shipping on my next order. As if I‚Äôd order from them again!!
vivino	DK	Customer service like no other	13 August 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Excellent customer service! Actually, best one I had in years üëçüëçüëçThey figured out my order made no sense and called to check if that‚Äôs what I really wanted ( I didn‚Äôt ). Great communication and easy to reach out. Responsive on both phone and mail.
vivino	GB	Contributed for years now there‚Äôs a fee for basic features	28 August 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Another user of the apps for years and now can‚Äôt even scan a wine to get a rating. Fine if you were to ask a sub for more complex features, but scanning and rating helps you provide a better service to others. App is now useless without a sub so will look for something else.
vivino	US	I have been using Vivino for years to‚Ä¶	27 June 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I have been using Vivino for years to just check ratings from users on wine but after  basically being blind sided by the abrupt closure of Underground Cellar and their business practices I have turned to Vivino for my wine purchases from their vendors and have not been disappointed.  Vivino keeps track of your orders and makes sure your orders ships or communicates if there is a delay.  Don‚Äôt hesitate Vivino is for real, give them a try you won‚Äôt be disappointed.
vivino	US	Thrilled about my first experience	14 June 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I recently made my first purchase and was very impressed with this site‚Äôs ease of use, excellent communications and support.  The wines I bought are manufactured in Moldova, my homeland that I recently visited and got to try them there. Lupii by Gitana winery is a cashmere red blend  with a 75% base of Cabernet and a delightful wine. I am so thrilled that this site made it available for purchase in the US, what a treat!
vivino	DE	Love it	19 June 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	It's not only an app - it's my notebook for my tastings & suggestion pool. Only one drawback - you can't ship the desirable wine to every country you wish to.
vivino	US	Now residing in Georgia	14 May 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Now residing in Georgia, my wife enjoys a specific wine from California and we asked a few package stores if they could bring in the item.  No luck at any stores.  Started shopping online and found the pricing was the same as what we paid when we lived in California.  Had the wine delivered to our home within a week.  Great experience.
vivino	FR	A great first purchase from Vivino	17 April 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	My son brought some Australian wine from England which was very good. After checking the details on Vivino they sent an interesting offer to purchase the same wine. The price was the best seen and as a sweetener they offered free delivery. The wine (The Black Stump, Durif Shiraz 2021) and the offer were too good to miss. Easy to order on line and delivery was ahead of the scheduled date. Altogether excellent service.
vivino	US	Good overall	10 May 2023	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	Good overall.  However, considering that someone 21 years old must sign, it would be nice if Vivino used a logistics company or app that had more flexibility.  We had to jump through hoops to have the package dropped at a center to pick-up.
vivino	US	The order arrived fast and well packed	28 June 2023	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	The order arrived fast and well packed. We have only tried one bottle of wine so far, and unfortunately we did not like it. To make matters worse, it was a $36 bottle of wine. I wish there was a way to get a full or even partial refund on bottles they match you with that end up not being one you enjoy. Another wine club I am apart of does that and it‚Äôs something that keeps me as a customer coming back because I know my preferences matter to them.
vivino	US	Very Good First Experience‚Ä¶	04 April 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Learned of a moderate priced Pinot in Wine Spectator that I thought worth a try.  Went to vinyard's website, and vintage recommended was no longer available.   Found on Vivino via Google, so ordered a case and shipping was also very reasonable.   Very good experience.
vivino	JP	I dont buy any wines without checking‚Ä¶	11 June 2023	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	I dont buy any wines without checking Vivino first. A supermaket offered an Amarone for a very low price. Seemingly a good buy but when checking Vivino, the price on offer was basically normal street value. Thanks Vivino for guiding me every time.
vivino	US	Even after I dithered 4-months before‚Ä¶	17 June 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Even after I dithered 4-months before ordering the wine that I spotted, Vivino had the item in stock and readily available.  I had it in my hands within 3 or 4 days, at the price originally offered.
vivino	US	Need a better courier company.	20 June 2023	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	As I didn't receive anything for four days I finally called after a week and asked when my order would be shipped and I was told it would arrive the next day.  So I waited at home but it did not arrive till Friday.  I understand it is the courier but if you are using a courier company, shouldn't you be able to coordinate with them so that they send you an email letting you know the date and an approximate time of delivery?
vivino	ES	Ruined.	09 August 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	This was a very good app. Now it‚Äôs next to useless as you can‚Äôt look up selection of wines you are considering or purchasing without agreeing to yet another monthly subscription.  I‚Äôve bought a lot through the app over the years which should be more than enough ‚Äúgain‚Äù for the owners but refuse to go down the sub path. I‚Äôm not alone. Bye bye.
vivino	US	I‚Äôve had a really good experience with‚Ä¶	23 April 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I‚Äôve had a really good experience with Vivino from beginning to end. Their website is easy to navigate and had just enough info to be helpful.  I was pleased with the discount I received but was a little disappointed when I thought it was going to take a couple of weeks to receive my wine. However, it actually came in just a few days!  I will definitely use Vivino again and will recommend it to others.
vivino	US	Extremely disappointed‚Ä¶I placed an ‚Ä¶	23 July 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Extremely disappointed‚Ä¶I placed an  order of almost $600 in wine, Sunday July 23rd. Today is August 1st and According to Vivino, the order was delivered yet I didn‚Äôt receive anything nor signed for any package while showing my ID like I have done with FedEx in the past with other orders I h placed with this company. I received two FedEx tracking numbers, one shows order being delivered the second one states the order is being processed. Credit card has been charged, still haven‚Äôt received any wine. I contacted customer service and they can‚Äôt assist. I  even asked for proof of signature and no one seems to be able to provide that. I will never use Vivino again.
vivino	US	Sometimes you just need a nudge...	09 May 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Liked the unsolicited offer to purchase a wine I had just reviewed and liked.  This then ended up being the easiest case of wine I ever ordered, because it was a few buttons to push on the app, and then 3 days later the wine was delivered to my front door.  The most low hassle easy wine purchase I have made to date.
vivino	US	EVERYTHING ABOUT YOUR WEBSITE	16 May 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	"EVERYTHING ABOUT YOUR WEBSITE, PLACING AN ORDER, PAYING AND RECEIVING THE SELECTED WINES BY MYSELF, ALL WERE GREAT!

vivino	CA	Late arrival	28 June 2023	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	The wine arrived fine, however according to my tracking app, it sat in the Kelowna airport for three plus days before it got picked up and delivered to my home! That needs to improve!
vivino	US	I love Vivino!	04 June 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I got a great deal on a wonderful case of my favorite Chardonnay.  It was delivered in just a few days and I even got free shipping with it!  I have never been disappointed with Vivino and highly recommend it!
vivino	US	A meaningful proportion of the wine we‚Ä¶	05 August 2023	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	A meaningful proportion of the wine we received was corked, we had 2 bad bottles of expensive champagne.  Not judging but it seems that the sources are not shipping their best bottles through this service. We‚Äôre really not using it anymore‚Ä¶
vivino	US	Fantastic prices, fast shipping	07 June 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Purchased several bottles of wine for great prices! Packaging was excellent and everything arrived safely. Would definitely purchase through Vivino again.
vivino	US	First time order very successful!	29 March 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Ordering the wine was easy! I even forgot to use a code to get 15% off. I contacted customer service immediately after placing my order and they were able to refund the discount! The wine arrived just fine and I was notified along the way. I'll be ordering again!

If I want to continue using Vivino, apparently I have to take out their ""Premium"" subscription.  Their app is designed not to give you alternatives, and communication directly appears non existent. So, so disappointed."
vivino	US	Following up my negative review from‚Ä¶	15 June 2023	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	Following up my negative review from the issue I had,  Vivino did resolve the issue appropriately,  albeit a bit slowly in my thinking. Customer service was very helpful when I placed a follow up call the rep was able to resolve in a few mns.
vivino	CA	A wonderful wine	19 June 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Painless!! No lugging of wine which is welcome when you are in apartment living. Service was easy and seemless. Such a delight. This wine is so smooth and tickles my tastebuds. Just so enjoyable
vivino	US	I started about two weeks ago trying to‚Ä¶	31 August 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I started about two weeks ago trying to buy 6 bottles of Sling and Spear Zin and 6 bottles of 770 Miles zin.  When you click on the wine as it heads to your cart each wine registered a 12 bottle purchase.  Nothing on the website says case purchases are necessary.  I know this because I frequent several wine sites where it is clear that the prices reflect a minimum 12 bottle purchase.When I reduced the buy for each wine to 6 bottles, the price for the 770 miles Zin stayed the same, but the Sling and Spear price went from 17.99 to 21.99. I emailed them and asked them to honor the price shown on their website.  They said I misunderstood their pricing and then said the price was set by the wine shop.  The wine shop said the price and any discounts was set by Vivino!!  Vivino offered a 10% discount and I said that it would need to be close to 20% to get from 21.99 to 17.99.  No response.  I asked for my request be sent to a supervisor and have not had a response in over a week.Vivino's coupon code was valid thru 8/31, so on 8/31 I placed an order for 12 bottles of Klinker Brick OV Zin  2016.  I got all the way through the order process and hit the buy button, but the Vivino site said there was an internal error and did not process the order.  I sent a picture of the screen to Vivino and they said that maybe my CVC code was incorrectly entered, but also said that perhaps my bank put a hold on my purchases.  BTW I have purchased several cases this year from Vivino using the same credit card.I went back and entered the CVC codes for multiple credit cards and tried to make my purchase.  I get the same error message.  All the credit cards were issued by  different banks, so I was not cut off by the banks!  Today I bought a mixed case of wine from Wine.com using my main credit card that Vivino rejected, so its not my credit cards at fault.No customer support at Vivino seems to understand that their website is at fault.  At present I have a 10% coupon good until 9/30.
vivino	US	We love the Vivino app and use it‚Ä¶	12 June 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	We love the Vivino app and use it often. My husband and I were out to dinner and  enjoyed a wonderful bottle of wine recommended by our server. We liked it so much that we searched on the app and ordered a case. It came quickly. Great resource for those who enjoy good wine.
vivino	US	Easy to order	06 June 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Easy to order! Great selection and prices are reasonable. Only thing is to have a person over 21 to sign. Had to leave at another location due to my work schedule.

vivino	US	Could not beat the price of the wine	24 April 2023	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	Could not beat the price of the wine, however, previous reviews were overrating. The wine is probably that of Languedoc whose weather is a bit too hot for pinot noir. Nonetheless, the wine shows decently for the price.

vivino	US	Second chance for Vivino	16 April 2023	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	UPDATE:  I posted the review below after frustration with Vivino.  Should not have had to do this.  HOWEVER - in hours after posting, I received a message from a new customer service person that had stepped in.  She immediately rectified the problem in the best manner possible.  I appreciate that they took responsibility and I look forward to more orders with them.----------------Ordered 6 bottles of Hess cab. Received 2 cabs and 4 Pinot. Contacted VIVINO customer service (Trix) to correct order by sending 4 cab or refund.  Waited to hear back. 3 weeks later VIVINO says their vendor wasn‚Äôt responding. Told me to send 4 Pinot back and thereafter would process refund - but I don‚Äôt trust them based on service provided.  Required me to use original shipping material (long since gone) within 14 days of purchase (long since past). This is their problem to fix not mine.  They are shifting burden to customer. Now I have 4 Pinot that I paid 20% higher cab price for. VIVINO IS LAZY AND TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE.
vivino	US	I placed an order through Vivino	15 July 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I placed an order through Vivino.  The wines never arrived.  Apparently it went back to the shipper due to damage en route.  I tried calling (no answer) and have sent multiple emails with no reply.  They promise a response within 1-2 business days, and now 3 weeks later and 6 emails later, they are non-responsive.  I'm sure they are fine as long as no hiccups, but they seem to lack any customer service.  And they're trying to keep the money I paid for wine that was never delivered!
vivino	AU	Really poor customer service	30 June 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Really poor customer service. Delivered 12 bottles of the wrong wine, which has been picked up by the supplier but after two weeks we still have not received our refund and after several attempts cannot get a response from Vivino about our refund. The supplier has provided evidence to us that they have refunded Vivino, yet we still do not have ours. Terrible experience.
vivino	US	This is a professional and pride filled‚Ä¶	12 April 2023	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	This is a professional and pride filled operation.  Communication is low key and that in this email crazed day will bring me back.  They had a good pricing and fast service. I will be using them again.  Take a look and you will be glad your choice.  I will order again.
vivino	US	I just returned from a trip to Israel‚Ä¶	17 April 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I just returned from a trip to Israel and wanted to purchase wine from the region. An internet search brought me to Vivino. I found what I was looking for at a reasonable price and with quick delivery.
vivino	US	3 wrong shipments in a row!!	08 July 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Be prepared to receive the wrong and cheaper vintage. Was using Vivino for years without issues but totally disappointed lately. Joined Vivino Plus since I used to order on a regular basis. Received 2 orders in a row with a cheaper and unwanted replacement. Kept them after complaining and canceled my membership. I gave it another try this month and exactly the same issue. The newer vintage was really bad so I decided to return the case. Besides the hassle I have not received my refund even though the return shipment arrived a week ago. When ordering there is no option to indicate ‚Äú no vintage replacement ‚Äú. Guess the reason is obvious. Canceled my membership again and will not order again from Vivino.
vivino	DE	Terrible customer service	03 August 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Delivered cheaper wine instead of ordered (and paid) champagne, wrote multiple emails and called customer service, they keep ignoring it. Will not order again.
vivino	US	I love wine	16 May 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I love wine, it is easy to purchase online, lots of wine to choose from & they keep you updated on your purchase right through to delivery.
vivino	US	God first experience	10 April 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I was able to find a good deal on a wine I had recently tasted and really enjoyed, especially with the 10% coupon for new customers. Shipping was quick and communication was good.

vivino	AU	Premium leaving a corked wine taste	24 August 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I‚Äôve been using Vivino for almost 10 years now and have contributed reviews and spent a significant amount of wine through their site and now they‚Äôre asking to pay for some of their standard offerings and get rid of the tacky adds I‚Äôll be looking at other options.
vivino	US	Great Service	28 May 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	The shipment is always timely and the wine is packaged very securely.  We never have any problems with our orders.
vivino	US	Every email touting wine isn't always worth it. This one was.	30 May 2023	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	Every email touting wine is over the top. My wine budget isn't that big that I can buy that much wine. I do pick and choose wines through other sites to see if the wine deserves the hype. This last shipment certainly did. I would have bought more, but cellar space is full.
vivino	US	Terrible customer service	07 June 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Terrible customer service - missing 6 bottles of wine - then out of no where showed up - in the mean time returned 6 bottles of partial shipment. Waiting 6 weeks for credit - the 1 and only phone number you can get to address problem is customer service - Ahmed has no power to do anything except to wait 5-10 business twice. There is no upper management that they will allow you to talk to - no number for Office in San Fransisco - I even tried Denmark. If you have a problem it‚Äôs a dead end customer adventure.The is the worst company I have ever in my life dealt with. Probably 90% of the orders are fine but what if your one of the 10% I have been waiting for a credit for almost 3 weeks.

vivino	US	Great Fun Until Something Goes Wrong.	29 June 2023	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	Generally, I like this site but when something goes wrong there is no customer service.  Just had a bottle break in transit so UPS returned it to merchant.  Had one interaction with VIVINO's chat feature.  No response.  Tried again and assistance wrote that they had no record of my first conversation.  Now, it has been over a week and no response.  Just went to my credit card company to dispute the charge.  I'm out the cost of the wine, plus the $7.99 UPS charged me to redirect it to a UPS store.

vivino	US	Thank You!	28 March 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	The app is so easy to navigate. It allows me to filter for the rating and price per bottle that meets my needs. Shipping is fast, safe and efficient!
vivino	AU	Delivered the wrong wine	07 June 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Delivered the wrong wine. Sent details and photos but customer support is the worst I have ever encountered. I am still waiting for a resolution after numerous attempts to follow up. I will never deal with Vivino again.Update: AUSPOST has now picked up the wrong wine but Vivino has not delivered the wine that I ordered. In hindsight I should have kept the wrong wine until receipt ( if ever ) of the right wine. Vivino is great on platitudes but appalling on customer service - don't buy from them.
vivino	US	Shipped me an unwanted substitute	10 July 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	A few weeks ago, I would have given Vivino 5 stars. But my recent experience has caused my opinion to go down dramatically. I tried a wine from a local store and really like it so I ordered a case from Vivino. With no advance notice or request, I received a completely different case of wine with a note enclosed that since the wine I ordered was not available, they substituted it. Although the note said it was a comparable wine, that‚Äôs not the point. I ordered the wine I wanted and did not want a substitute. And I ordered a case of 2018 Cabernet and was shipped a case of 2021 Cabernet. This was unacceptable. I have sent repeated emails to the help email given to me, with no response. Unfortunately I will have to start a dispute with my credit card company and cancel my membership with Vivino as I can no longer trust them. Very bad customer service when things go wrong.
vivino	CA	Received order promptly	24 June 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Received order promptly. Delivery driver text me that  he was at my house. I was 5 mins away and he waited for me.  Awesome service!
vivino	US	I am so angry about this purchase	24 May 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I am so angry about this purchase. It was shipped in Styrofoam. This can‚Äôt be recycled and can‚Äôt even be excepted by our local garbage collection because it is so horrible for the environment. This is totally irresponsible, and I will never order again.  I contacted customer service and asked to please ship the Styrofoam back, but not at my expense and, of course I did not receive any reply.  Don‚Äôt ever order anything from one shop in Los Angeles and if you order anything from Vivino make sure it is not going to be shipped in Styrofoam but I don‚Äôt think they have any control over that.

It was supposed to be a gift, but the person is leaving and won‚Äôt receive it on time. No costumer service, they say they don‚Äôt know anything and they will respond in an email which they never send. Apparently it hasn‚Äôt even left the deposit. I feel like they simply stole my money and I feel so sad bc my partner won‚Äôt receive his gift.
vivino	US	Not a great 1st impression	26 April 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Glad I placed a smaller order of only $250 to test this company. I have another $1400 worth of wine in cart.  I placed my order on 4/19/2023 and received an email on 4/20 stating that fedex received shipping label and delivery would be on 4/25. Received no other shipping information. After checking fedex, they no longer have shipping date and stated they haven‚Äôt received package from seller. I‚Äôve had 2 emails and a phone conversation with Vivino about this and they keep stating they are reaching out to seller but haven‚Äôt heard anything from them. Vivino states shipping within 48 hours of ordering. It‚Äôs been 7 days and never received product I ordered, Vivino seems like they can‚Äôt get ahold of seller.

vivino	US	First World Problem for First Order	03 May 2023	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	I‚Äôm not sure what to think about my first order through Vivino. I ordered 6 bottles of a specific wine on Monday. Vivino app as well as the store site indicated there were 6 bottles available. I placed an order for all 6 and was notified that it was processed on Tuesday. On Wednesday, I received an email update stating the order was taking a little longer to process. On Thursday I was informed that the specific wine was not available and would not be shipped. On Friday I checked the store site, and the inventory was updated. The update indicated there were now 11 bottles of the specific wine I ordered. So, my first order through Vivino was a bust however, It was most likely the wine merchant & not Vivino, never the less, Vivino gets the poor review as the order middleman.
vivino	US	Easy	21 June 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Easy, quick and accurate from start to finish. The price point was competitive and overall a very positive experience.
vivino	US	This process has been a nightmare	06 June 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	This process has been a nightmare! After a week with no indication of delivery, I wrote an email, besides a canned response, nothing.  I think chatted, they needed to check with the merchant and get back to me..... nothing.  I called, talked with a rep. they needed to talk with the merchant again Nothing! Nothing!  NO is idea what is going on but no more orders from me.
vivino	US	Should be zero stars.  Garbage customer service	21 May 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Should be zero stars.  Worst customer service of any company I've ever dealt with.  I ordered 12 bottles of 2018 vintage Quilt Cabernet Sauvignon at $54.99 each plus tax.  I received 6 bottles of that, plus a note explaining that you only had 6 but you've replaced the remaining 6 with 6 of a different vintage that cost the same or more.  Why would you ship anything other than what I ordered without asking me first?  That could have saved the relationship and would have been the right thing to do.  Second, the wine you sent is considerably less expensive @ $37 per bottle.  So you've fraudulently misled me.  Did you think I wouldn't check or wouldn't care?I wrote to Vivino on 5/16 to let you know of this issue and still have not heard back from you.  Wow.  Horrible customer service.  I should have stuck with my inclination to not do business with Vivino after a similar incident a few years ago.  My mistake, which won't happen again.

When I  contacted customer service they suggested that I should keep the substitution as it was a ""better wine"".  I replied no.  Then I was offered a 10% discount on my next order. I replied no. More offers and compensation offered, (I suspect there's a flowchart of compensatory offers Vivino customer service follows to resolve this type of problem). My question is -- If you don't actually have the ordered product available for shipment as advertised and purchased, why would you not at least contact the customer prior to sending a crappy substitution to confirm acceptance?  Not a respectful company IMO"

I did a google search for a particular wine and vintage. 2 or 3 choice was Vivino. Went to their website ordered a case. Received the wine quickly and packaged well. When I opened the box I confirmed the wine but I ordered the 2018 vintage and they sent me 2019 in error. Went to their website found the number and hours of business. Have tried calling and no one is available to speak to. Tried their chat feature and same thing no one is available to chart. I have tried a couple of times both calling and chat but no one available. This wasn‚Äôt a cheap purchase over $600. I was looking for the specific vintage as a gift. Was just going to email their customer service. So will update if I get this resolved. Buyer is in Michigan.

vivino	US	1 minute after I ordered the wine‚Ä¶	02 March 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	1 minute after I ordered the wine realized the shipping address was incorrect. I tried changing it but the app trough me into a never ending loop not allowing me to do so. The last recourse was to send an email - which I did - asking for a change of address. I called the 1800 number the very next morning during working hours. I was informed I had to wait 24-48 hours after the email was sent prior to calling to get a response. So bottom line the wine is probably not good now. My advice to you the next shopper is to be very very careful not to miss type anything because THAT is where it will end up even if you call the customer center I can‚Äôt give it a zero star so one is what they get

I was just very disappointed that the ‚Äúsmall‚Äù ice packs (one per 6 bottles) were completely unfrozen and nearly warm when my order arrived. Given that it was relatively cool outside, I highly doubt that I will be able to order wine during warmer months (which is most of the year where I live) unless there is an improvement to the shipping process.

vivino	US	Wrong Wine Sent	26 February 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I ordered a case of Grand Cru pinot noir.  I received a case of Redwood Vineyards pinot noir.  Upon calling the company they tell me Grand Cru is out of stock, so they sent this replacement.  This is without notifying me in advance.  They just took it upon themselves to send me wine I did not order.  This seems to be an ongoing customer complaint with Vivino, referred to as bait and switch.  I decided to keep the wine but will never order from them againUPDATE and REPLY:  Your team did not resolve the issue.  You sent me wine I did not order because you could not get the wine I did order.  That in itself would never be an issue if I was told beforehand by your team that the wine I ordered was not available - would I like a substitute.  This is the part your missing, you took it upon yourself to make the decision for me.  If you look at the reviews for Vivino, it's a constant complaint - Vivino substitutes wine without notifying the customer in advance.  Your attempt to give me a 40% discount on future orders is not solving the problem because I wouldn't order from you again

vivino	CH	Enhancements	20 February 2023	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	I like the application and my ability to find information quickly. It is a good application, with huge but untapped potential. Good things you don't need to fix. Consequently, I am providing you feedback on things I think you should improve. I don't like that I receive all of these Vivino questionnaires and information in German. Surely you should be using the default language of the customer's browser or at least give me the possibility to choose it in the app, and then use this default. I also think the shopping cart is easy to make mistakes on. I would prefer to order and pay in one go, without going to the cart. I should have the option of doing one or the other and clearing the cart before I start. I think Vivino needs to expand into a more market based application, with prices (and other MI) determined by vineries and not only customers. The order itself took a while to get here. I didn't realise it was coming from Germany.

However, when you first order one you can see what's in it and change the price value of the box. Once locked in you can't and that is a real shame. I tried to get a more expensive box at Christmas with the hope of seeing what was in it and could not. Probably worth cancelling subscription after every order and starting a new one every 3 months.

vivino	US	Crooks! A-holes & crooks!	05 February 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	"Ordered a case of wine. They sent me one bottle & done (apparently that was all that the vendor had). They then kept ALL of the shipping fees & taxes. So, they had me paying something like $40 to get one $15 bottle of wine delivered. I'd give them a better rating if, when asked about it, they acknowledged the error, apologized sincerely, and fixed it right away. [Honestly, I would have expected the an ""over-fix"" such as just refunding all of the money and letting me keep the one bottle (particularly since I was a first time customer).] BUT, they could not possibly have been bigger a-holes about the situation. It took something like 30 minutes to resolve. They never acknowledged any mistake and only refunded the minimum amount ""as a courtesy"". A ""courtesy""? Vivino robbed me, got caught, tried to deny it, and when finally completed busted, did the absolute minimum required by common decency & consumer protection laws. They then had the unmitigated gall to call that a ""courtesy""? A ""courtesy""? F you, F you, and F you!!! NEVER buy from these a-holes."

I ordered a case of one wine and despite having all my contact information to gain approval, they sent me completely different wine with a note that they were out of stock of the wine I ordered and have replaced it with another ‚Äúmore expensive‚Äù wine. I have requested a refund and for them to pick-up the random wine they sent.
vivino	US	Extremely Disappointing	31 January 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	So I have used WINEX for nearly 30 years to keep my substantial wine cellar stocked.  Recently, I thought that I would try Vivino.  The first two orders worked out fine. Today I received my third order.  A bottle of 2012 Dom Perignon which I ordered as a 30th birthday gift for my son. The cardboard box arrived in less than stellar condition and I was surprised to find that the Dom box was not shipped with the Champagne.  I had also paid extra for ice packs.  The single very small pack was old and certainly was not cold. I immediately wrote Vivino Customer Support.  I just received a reply. It was condescending and unhelpful.  It basically said that Vivino uses many stores to fill orders and they were not responsible.  In essence Vivino‚Äôs stressing that they are middlemen.  He also wrote that maybe the ice pack had warmed during the shipping.  With respect to my request to send the Dom packaging, he said the cardboard box was all that was required. The reply was terrible.  I know now why I have used WINEX for my wine needs.  I have always received what I paid for over the many years from WINEX and they are responsible and accountable for what they sell. Shame on Vivino for passing the buck on this and sending such a horrible response. Buyer beware with this sophomoric business model.Update: The written reply from the company looks strangely similar to all of their other replys to constructive comments.  What is missing from their reply to me and everyone else is an effort to make the situation right.  All platitudes‚Ä¶no action.  This is not a serious customer focused entity.

vivino	CA	Bait and Switch, stay away	14 January 2023	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	On my very first order with Vivino and probably my last I ordered a couple of bottles of Beringer Private Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon 2016. I was going to order a case but wanted to be cautious being a new supplier to me. The process was easy and shipping was quite quick. Unfortunately this is was were things fell apart. Upon opening the box I see the packing slip listing my order correctly. I then open the box further to see 2 bottles of wine that were not only from a totally different vineyard but from 2019. This is totally unacceptable. I have a wine tasting event and was planning on having them as part of that and now that's ruined. So then I try to find how to get support and that wasn't easy. But when I finally did get support although they were very friendly they really couldn't tell me much and I still don't know what the status of my order is and frankly can't believe how little they care about customers. Also there customer support is off shore some place and it's hard to have a conversation with them due to lag. Based on this experience I'm not sure why anyone would deal with them.UPDATE: Support reached out and corrected the order and I received the correct wine which I originally ordered. The person from support was professional, quite responsive and kept me updated. Unfortunately, I don't think the company cares about  my time that they wasted and effort that was needed to get this solved. Based on this experience I'm not sure if I will try again. My annual wine expenditures is only 15-20K so it's not like they will miss my business. But based on the other reviews it seems this is a very common problem and somewhat duplicitous in nature so beware of doing business with them. Whether it's them or their partners it's unclear however ultimately it's their problem. Interestingly none of the private collectors I deal with use Vivino.

I had to contact customer service 3 different times to figure out what was going on with my order. They finally figured out that one of the wines I ordered was out of stock. If a wine is out of stock, that should be reflected on the website. Although they finally shipped my wine from a different warehouse where it was in stock, I wonder if I ever would have received the wine if I didn‚Äôt call multiple times to inquire about it. Additionally, no one ever apologized. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be ordering from Vivino again. They don‚Äôt seem to care about their customers.

vivino	US	This is a decent bottle of wine	07 January 2023	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	So I am a frequent traveler to Lyon, and I am a major fan of Cotes de Rh√¥ne as an appellation. That said, this bottle is okay, but not one of the better ones available. I would say that the Vivino marketing was a tad on the over positive side. I was unable to taste the different qualities noted in the review. In my judgment, this wine was over priced for what it is ‚Äî an average representative of the variety. It would sell for a whole lot less in France, I think.

Sadly, Vivino is sourcing out low-class, unprofessional liquor stores, to fulfill their orders. And mind you, some of these stores wouldn't know the difference between Harlan Estate and Sutter Home. Then, to make matters all the more worse, their customer service / support is outside the USA. I don't care what kind of 20% off coupon codes they send me, I have plenty of high-end, reputable, classy wine shops throughout the country, who ship promptly to my door. Vivino is an interesting concept, but not my cup of tea or brand of vodka.

Received 2020 stating that they have the right to change vintage years if the one requested is not available. The gave me 10% off so I tried again with 6 bottles with the exact same result and explanation. they keep saying  ""well its the same wine""  No... Its not. Customer service is obviously farmed out over seas and is very difficult to communicate with.Will not be working with them ever again."

Pr√ºm Essence Raimund Prum Riesling  which is not what I ordered. I was told by Nikko the seller  did not have the S.A. Pr√ºm Essence Riesling 2020 available for replacement at this time. He went on to say what I received was ""actually better rated (having the same 4.0 star rating with more than 4 times the number of reviews) and is valued higher on average than the original wine"" This is a classic case of ‚Äúbait n switch‚Äù.  I did challenge this and complain and they offered to refund my money if I shipped it back at my cost or received a measly 15% refund. We chose the refund."

vivino	US	Delivered wine different from what was ordered	21 December 2022	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	Update:  I did finally receive a response from Vivino just over a week after submitting my problem to them.  They issued a refund, so made the best out of a bad situation.  As a result I am changing my rating from 1 star to 3 stars.  Not great, but at least they owned up to the mistake and tried to make it better so I'll give them a middle-of-the-road score.  Original review:  I ordered 3 bottles of a specific wine for my mother-in-law, who is not a big wine fan but had discovered this particular vineyard and style that she likes.  I found it in-stock here, and ordered it for delivery before Christmas.  Pricing and shipping was reasonable, and delivery was prompt.  However, upon opening the box I found that I received 3 bottles of a different wine.  There was a note saying essentially sorry we don't have the wine you ordered so gave you something different instead.  It was from the same vineyard, and a comparable style, and I have no doubt it is a quality wine.  However it is not what I ordered, and I received no communication on this change.....just discovered it upon opening the box.  So it comes across as a definite bait & switch or just a money-grab.  I understand that inventory can change, but if that occurred after my order was placed just let me know and let me choose an alternate (or cancel the order).  And if it was never in stock to begin with, that is just wrong to accept the order to begin with.  I view it similar to going to buy a Subaru for a car....but when you go to pick it up they give you a Ferrari instead and say I should be happy because it is a highly rated and more expensive vehicle.  Perhaps so, but it doesn't meet any of the criteria I used when selecting and purchasing initially.  So all in all I received 3 bottles of fine wine that someone will enjoy.  Just not the intended person.  And I will not be a repeat customer due to the lack of communication (not just before/during the order, but also no response after an email submitted upon receipt on 12/21....currently 12/26).  So buyer beware....if you are OK getting whatever bottles that they deem as appropriate, the pricing and delivery is great.  But if you want something specific, you may be unhappy at the end of the day.

vivino	US	I  ordered 12 bottles of wine and got rotten wine.	22 December 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I  ordered 12 bottles of wine. The wine storage was bad and the wine went really bad. The wine was over the hill. Wine smell was really bad and it likes rotten hay and the color was brown. I open three bottles for my party and all of my friend spit it out. I opened one more bottle, and it is same, not drinkable nor cannot to use for cooking. Each bottle is over 40 dollars. I didn't mention wine maker, because it is not wine maker's fault. Absolutely, the problem is storage.I called VIVINO and they said they cannot accept items back because I received the wine more than fourteen day ago. VIVINO is not reliable and is not responsible company. We shouldn't buy from VIVINO, because VIVINO is not handle wine, they just get order and other small wine shop delivers wine. So VIVINO cannot control storage and VIVINO refuse responsibility. I strongly recommend NOT ORDER WINE FROM VIVINO. They refuse responsibility and they do not control storage of wine.

vivino	AU	Money grubbing bean counters	09 December 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	"Money grubbing bean counters. Also, I've lost confidence in their ratings, my last purchase (over$400) rated at 4.3 stars which should be a great wine but I thought it was way off the mark wrt quality and value.  I know everyone's taste is different and maybe I was just unlucky with this purchase. I can't be bothered going to the hassle of packing it up to send it back at this time of year. But what grinds my gears of that they offered a 10% discount voucher to make amends.  This means I would have to spend money to get right and they would still make profit off me despite having stuffed up, so no recompense for the customer but the bean counters are very pleased with themselves.  Even if they gave me $40 cash that would be something but this is just plain rude. I don't care if it's ""policy"" or ""everyone else does it"", it still sucks."

vivino	US	Nice wine if you actually get it	03 December 2022	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	We had sampled the wine we purchased at a restaurant thoroughly enjoy it and wanted to buy more for ourselves and for gifts. Vivinno was an easy source. They promised delivery and properly packaged the wine so it was nestled in sturdy packaging on its side. However we have ONE GIANT COMPLAINT They shipped through UPS. Alcohol must be signed for by an adult. The day before delivery UPS promised delivery  between 2:00-6:00 PM. On the actual date of delivery UPS updates the delivery window from 2:00pm -9:00 pm. That‚Äôs a 7 hour delivery window! And to add insult to injury, UPS texted they had delivered our package and we had signed for it. They in fact had delivered the package to our neighbor who fortunately read the name on the package and was honest enough to contact us about the incorrect delivery. We loved to do business with vivinno again, but are concerned about losing 2 bottles of very expensive wine.

vivino	US	My favorite part of the Vivino app is‚Ä¶	28 November 2022	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	My favorite part of the Vivino app is its ability to find wines that are similar to your desired taste profile. I have placed 5 orders with Vivino in the past two years, and this is the first time that they charged me shipping ($50 for delivery to Hawaii). I would give a rating of 5 stars, but I had to settle with 4 due to the Vivino plus advertisement being misleading. There are constant ads promoting free shipping through the Vivino plus membership, which you sign up for during check out. However, when I tried to figure out how to sign up, there was no way for me to locate the Vivino plus membership in the check out process.

vivino	CA	Slow and Awkward Delivery Process	15 November 2022	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	I found the delivery speed and process very slow and awkward.  I would suggest that if you wish to play in the home delivery business, you need to function a little closer to what Amazon manages to accomplish.  I realize you're not Amazon (nor do they always get it right) and don't likely have their resources, but the speed was too slow.  Also, the interface with the delivery process/company wasn't great.  Due to the fact that you must be home and sign for the wine delivery (certainly I understand that need), there needs to better coordination with the homeowner and ensure someone will be there at the prescribed time.  I haven't yet tried the wine, but frankly that is the vineyard's issue if not to likely and Vivino is simply the intermediary and process that gets the wine to me.  With all the great wine stores available now, with great selection, it appears a far easier process to simply go and buy it.  Yes I may pay a little more, but frankly this process should have made life easier, not harder and I found the entire experience far more difficult than it should have been.  Sorry, I've been subscribed for many years watching all the deals and finally decided to make my first order and won't likely do it again.

vivino	US	Huge Disappointment	28 October 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I had the 2022 vintage of this Pinot Noir at a party. It was excellent. So I decided to take a gamble on the 2020. It was truly awful. Harsh, but also with a peculiar chemical-like taste that I‚Äôve not experienced with a wine before. Putting aside for the moment the offensive chemical taste‚Äîeven after trying a second bottle of the 2020, the difference between it and the later vintage was like drinking two different wines. Stay clear of this 2020 Pinot Noir.

vivino	AU	Diabolical	21 October 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	A few days after placing my order , I was notified that my wine order was damaged which is understandable - these things can happen . However , a replacement was not reordered until I enquired.  A week after my original order was placed it was ‚Äúunable‚Äùto be delivered by the courier as it took us more than 8 seconds to answer the doorbell and he promptly departed and left a card in the mailbox . The next day , I received a text  from shippit saying that my wine was to be redelivered that day. Nothing arrived .A day later the wine was finally delivered. To my horror it contained a shattered bottle and shards of glass within reach . Unprofessional and potentially dangerous . Vivino did , to their credit, refund me for the price of one bottle . Though I guess that was the least that i could expect . Oh and a code for a 10% discount on my next order . There will be no next order ! Account deleted. There are other places to buy wine .

vivino	US	Disappointing experience	01 October 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I had a very disappointing experience with Vivino.  The Vivino website does not allow you to send a note to the recipient when ordering a bottle as a gift as I was.  I therefore placed the order by phone and was promised by the Vivino service representative that my note would be sent separately to the recipient (my friend). That never occurred and until I checked with my friend, she had no idea who had sent the bottle. Being able to send a note to the recipient of a gift is very basic and it‚Äôs both surprising and disappointing to me that Vivino is unable to make this happen.

vivino	US	First time buy and super happy!	06 October 2022	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	This was my first time buying in Vivino! Was a great experience to buy directly from the site which I use so often to lookup the wine ratings. The only gotcha for me was when I was ordering multiple wines, it ended up being multiple carts and could not order all the wines of my choice since it got split into multiple merchants resulting in multiple shipping fee. To optimize that, I had to compromise buying wines available from a single merchant. Overall, it‚Äôs still a good experience. Also, while it was not advertised but even though I did not pay for expedited shipping, the delivery was super fast.. it was just 3-4 days.
vivino	US	Korbel California Champagne Brut	09 October 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	We ordered the Korbel Brut champagne for our wedding day.  The price was great and below the retail store prices.  The package arrived well ahead of time and we look forward to our wedding day toast.  Thank you.
vivino	US	Cumbersome experience. Lackluster. Annoying.	09 October 2022	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	"I decided to try Vivino because I wanted to gift my best friend a few bottles of wine. I place my order, got confirmation email and promise of shipping within 1-2 business days. After 4 days I received another email apologizing for the shipping delay and that they would NOW make sure it would indeed ship within the promised (next) 48h. It did not. After overall 8 days of delay, I emailed them for a follow-up and the representative was quite nice, provided me with a code for free shipping on next order. Later that same day, the order shipped. About two days later I get a notice of refund for one of the more rare bottles I had ordered. A French 2017 varietal. Turns out the winery fulfilling the order took so long to ship it, that they sold out on that wine. Did they contact me to let me know? Did they offer a substitution? No. Simply shipped and said nothing. First time I knew that one bottle would be missing was when I received a notice of refund. This practice is so absurd that I do not even know where to begin. Sure, my order had three different items, but it is ONE order. If it cannot be fulfilled, the customer must be contacted to either (1) offer a substitution, (2) offer to ship without and refund the missing items, or (3) offer to cancel the whole order. After all, the customer is paying the shipping costs. Imagine if you bought a car on the company's website and they shipped it with a different trim, then issued you a refund because they did not have the trim you ordered anymore. This is not how sales contracts work. After asking Vivino about it over email, they confirmed that a refund had been issued and suggested a similar wine, same price, from the same winery. I decided to give it one more chance and use the code for free shipping, in hopes that I would be able to complete the now late gift without extra costs. ""This code has already been used."" To add salt to the injury, my friend called me to say that FedEx never really attempted to deliver the wine today. It is Sunday. They were home all day waiting for this order since there was notice it would be delivered. FedEx simply left a note saying they'd try again. Never knocked, didn't ring the doorbell, neither attempted to call. As a trial run (1st time order), the still ongoing experience is not pleasant. Timeliness and communication between merchand and customer are both big issues. I was left really disappointed that we do not get to try the wine I wanted because the winery fulfilling the order decided they had better things to do. It is officially gone, sold-out. I am giving 2 stars instead of 1 because the representative that has been trying to help me over email has been really quick in responding and has put-in a decent effort. I am sure I will get a new free shipping code, but I am reluctant to go through this experience again."

vivino	US	Great idea - complicated to execute	24 September 2022	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	I was super happy to see the option of buying my favorite wines on Vivino. I ordered 2x cases for an event and the first case showed up with no problem. I think it was delivered directly from the wine store. The second case was being delivered by FedEx and it almost seemed impossible. They came by 3 times, they claimed. We were home all 3 times. I even asked them to call us in case we didn't hear the doorbell. They claimed to have done that, before the dropoff attempt, but I never had the several incoming calls they claimed to have done. I wish they could just drop the package off in the mailroom like all other packages. This is illegal to do with wine apparently which made this VERY difficult. It should have been seamless and easy. It was not. It took a lot of time, was stressful, and unnecessarily complicated. I got the wine at the end, but not in time for the event.

vivino	US	Since I frequently use Vivino to scan‚Ä¶	05 September 2022	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	Since I frequently use Vivino to scan wines before purchasing in a local store, I wanted to try ordering from Vivino since they should know my preferences. I have had mixed experiences with other wine clubs and generally avoid them. After a half bottle of wine, I decided to try Vivino‚Äôs wine club. The first half case was deeply discounted to a reasonable price, but I suspect prices were inflated to allow discounts. The second case will tell me if I want to continue or cancel.
vivino	US	Juan Gil 2019	04 September 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Second time ordering Juan Gil from Vivino. Both times the wine arrived within 3-4 business day. Packaging and price were perfect. Will definitely be a returning customer!

vivino	AU	5 Bottles missing from an order of 7 bottles	08 September 2022	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	I ordered 7 bottles (6 of one variety and 1 other) and received only one from each variety and the seller marked the order as fulfilled. I complained to customer service and then the seller accepted it was an error and  now customer service is telling they are going to send the missing 5 bottles. These kind of situations are quite inconvenient.

vivino	US	Overall it was good	31 August 2022	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	Overall it was good. This was my first purchase with Vivino. It wasn't their fault but it seemed wherever the wine was coming from definitely was not able to meet original time commitments. Thankfully it was not time sensitive,  but it took about a week longer than originally estimated. I appreciate that the shipping is a reasonable price.

We were in Ireland and loved a bottle of Cabernet the server had suggested and as we finished our meal I searched for this wine on Vivino and found it, The wine wa Xboxes well and delivered the next week at my front step.. I have now done this several times, and it is simple and reliable. They even follow up with the Wine store you purchase from if it is not sent promptly. Love this app!

Vino has yet after 4 days been able to get the seller to communicate back with them so they can correct my order. Why would I use this service again when there is no advantage to what they offer other than frustration. This service is not for me. I tried to support them but they were a big fail in my instance

vivino	US	Vintage Substition	29 August 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I ordered a 2020 Chardonnay and a 2021 was substituted. While I was ordering the wine I saw that the 2020 cost more than the 2021. I was disappointed to have a cheaper vintage substituted. I tried to contact VIvino on the app or email them and could not find contact information. I would not order from Vivino again. I don‚Äôt trust ordering from them.

vivino	US	Shipments during hot summer months.	29 August 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Received our case of wine a week ago today. Unfortunately there was lots of wine stains on the cardboard in the boxes. Six of the bottles are clearly missing wine. I have tried almost every day for a week to work with Vivino for a resolution. The phone number that they list for customer service Always says ‚Äúyour call cannot be completed at this time please try again‚Äù, We‚Äôve exchanged emails and did a live chat and still nothing. The ironic thing is today I received a phone call from them and asked me to return the call to the number that doesn‚Äôt work. As I‚Äôve spoken to fellow wine lovers they have told me that no reputable winery will ship wine during the hot summer months. Wished I had known that before I trusted Vivino with an order. Be wary of using them. They are trying to get me to keep the six bottles that didn‚Äôt lose the wine but are obviously baked. All I want to do is return the case and get a case that hasn‚Äôt been cooked.ViVino did make good on our wine delivery. They shipped a new case and were helpful. Thank you!

vivino	NL	Do not order via Vivino, you might not get what you looked at	24 August 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Interesting site to learn what others think about a wine.To order via VIVINO is dangerous. There are small letters indicating that sellers can sell other years if have to. But also need to contact first. This does not work in this over organised world‚Ä¶‚Ä¶nobody contacted me.

vivino	CA	Wrong wintage	19 August 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Husband ordered a case of 2018 wine, without asking they sent 2019, either they do not know wine or just do whatever they want. A 2019 is easy to get at a regular wine store.  Looks like this is a common theme for the bad reviews left here, wish we had seen this before ordering. And also checking the reviews looks like an automated reply from them that end with hope you give vivino another chance. Really? do you think a person who was ordering for the first time will order from you again when you don't handle an order properly, just send what you want without even a discount?  Clearly you have no quality control.

vivino	US	Major Delivery Problem	14 August 2022	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	Easy to purchase wine through Vivino, but delivery was a major problem. UPS notified me of a missed delivery on a Thursday, so I redirected package to my local UPS store. No update on package location Friday or over the weekend on either UPS phone app or online site (and no text or email update). I called UPS Monday morning, and they said package was at main UPS center. When I got to UPS center they could not find package, and had no idea of the location - their best guess was package was still on delivery truck, sitting in the sun for over three days. Finally Tuesday wine made it to local UPS store where I picked it up. Tried a bottle of the Chardonnay several days later and it was ok, but wondering how much the wine was degraded sitting in the hot truck for so long. Not necessarily Vivino‚Äôs fault, but nothing they would do to make things right!

vivino	GB	First time buy is successful so far üòÉ	12 August 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	This review just covers the buying experience. Basically I'm  attracted by the fact that each wine tends to have lots of reviews. However you have to take account of the fact that some reviews are of differing vintages. I am a member of the Wine Society and there is a paucity of reviews. Perhaps members are very knowledgeable and don't feel the need to share.Anyway, this was a trial order. I only used Vivino as the merchant as I don't  know what happens to shipping costs if you use multiple merchants.I placed the order on the evening and it was sent off the next day. Parcel force then kept it over the weekend and it duly arrived Monday. The wines are well packaged but I could do with a handhold each side of the box to help me lift it.I've tried one wine, a rose, which is excellent and a true reflection of the description. The others will be tried when an old friend arrives next week. I'm looking  forward to it.

vivino	AU	Address update Saga	01 August 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I am not really sure I want to leave any review at all since I am still in the same situation, frustration and total waste of time‚Ä¶ and all of this due to address update. You request that individual must  sign up in order to place an order. I would then think that I am able to log on and update my residential address as I need to log in and update my address. The fact that I sent Several Email and 4 phone calls to request that my address would be updated. And twice I receive email confirming that my address has been changed. Since it near impossible to update it myself EVEN with Vivino officer on the phone. Now I end up with 6 bottles out of 12 and still waiting for the missing box in the mail and 4 visits to Australia Post whom are puzzled delivering one box of 6 bottles but the other box is roaming around.

I had to reach out to Vivino to figure out what the game plan was to replace the package and got a weird auto-reply that demanded I reply within 48 hours or my order would be canceled. Really bad customer service.Then they did recover a little by responding with a real person who gave me some details about what the plan was to replace my order.

vivino	US	Very disappointed	12 July 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Very disappointed. First and last order I‚Äôll ever do. Order got delayed and it took 10 days to get it. Paid shipping and handling for nothing. I realized that I could‚Äôve gotten something similar or better at the closest grocery store without paying 15 dollars for shipping and handling. Customer service offered 10% off on my next order. Wow!! I could have given 0 stars, but unfortunately, there‚Äôs not such a thing..
vivino	US	I never received the wine I ordered	11 July 2022	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	"I never received the wine I ordered.  I received something similar, from the same winemaker.  When I contacted Vivino the answer was ""our supplier didn't have that wine in stock"".  Which is ridiculous.  Why would you just ship something else without asking for my consent?  And no information was provided as to what to do with the wine that was shipped?  I followed up and the second customer service rep clarified that the problem was on Vivino's end, and that they would figure out how to ship it back with the supplier.  I haven't heard back yet, nor have I received a refund.  Was able to purchase the correct wine for less $ from a different online merchant who got it here in 24 hours.  I love the wine community on Vivino but I won't purchase wine through them again."

vivino	US	I paid extra for ice packs	11 July 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I paid extra for ice packs. My wine showed up very hot, and could be damaged. The small ice pack was completely warm. This is not cold chain shipping. The wine is in jeopardy. I won‚Äôt order from Vinvino again in summer. Too risky.
vivino	US	Wine was delivered very warm	10 July 2022	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	The delivery of this wine was to South Florida, where it is hot year round, but especially during the summer.  Delivery was the 5th of July, so it is likely that the wine was on a truck all weekend long.  The box did not have any cooling packs to control the temperature of the wine. As a result, the bottles were very warm on arrival and it makes me wonder how those days of exposure to the heat has affected the character of the wine.  I'll know when I finally open a bottle.

vivino	GB	Dodgy and haphazard delivery‚Ä¶	29 June 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	"Dodgy and haphazard delivery experience. This may be the end of my relationship with Vivino if the delivery people cannot behave rationally. The first attempt at delivery was incorrectly marked on two simultaneous messages as delivered successfully to me and also that it ""could not be delivered"" to me so delivered to a mystery neighbour at a number on my street that does not exist (14a). The named individual also did not exist at number 14 and none of the neighbours could confirm awareness. Subsequently it was clarified that delivery had not been made to that address after all but instead placed behind unrecognisable bins without such instructions. Next I was advised that delivery would occur on a new date which came and went without any evidence on the Ring Doorbell of an effort to deliver. I've now tried to give them one more chance with alternative instructions but have very little confidence as this has clearly now become a joke for someone. Fingers crossed this will come soon."

vivino	US	For my first order	24 June 2022	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	For my first order, I chose the option of having ice added to the shipping carton (for an extra $5.00). The shipment arrived on a very hot day, with no ice, after several days in transit in unusually hit weather.  When I opened the the package, the bottles were very hot to the touch.

The only thing I will mention is I paid the $6 dollars for the cooler insert since it was really hot in Kansas City. When the wine arrived, the wine was warm, almost hot and hopefully will be okay. Not sure there is a solution to this particularly during these warmer months. The insert helped during the early days of shipping I am sure but doesn't last long enough for the length of time for a shipment to arrive.

vivino	US	Vivino, someone‚Äôs resource but not Customer Friendly	14 June 2022	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	Vivino showed me one new wine from a reputable source.  It was called Luva, a great value for a Tuscan blend.  It‚Äôs only drawback is sediment.  Then Luva disappeared from the Vivino site!There is no real way to inquire about the wine as the site is not set up for customer contact in any meaningful way.

vivino	AU	2017 Taltarni Cabernet Sauvignon	11 June 2022	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	Boy have the wines from Taltarni changed over time.  I remember the Estate Shiraz and Cabernet Sauvignon wines from the 1980‚Äôs well ‚Äì I lived up the road at St Arnaud for a while.  In those days the wines were huge ‚Äì well beyond full bodied.  They very regularly were tannic monsters that needed a couple of decades to come around.  I also remember some great 1970‚Äôs vintages of the Cabernet and Syrah (Shiraz) that I purchased whenever I visited Warrenmang in the 1990‚Äôs and ate at the magnificent restaurant (Saddle of Pyrennes Hare with Wild Rice is firmly in the memory bank) ‚Äì Warrenmang had a great cellar of all the fine wines from The Pyrenees (Luigi and Athalia at Warrenmang were great supporters of all the regional wineries).  But the world and the worm turns and so it is that I have tonight opened a 2017 Taltarni Estate Cabernet Sauvignon and it is starkly different to those enormous wines of the past.  This wine is deep red, garnet in colour and bright and reflective ‚Äì the equivalent of the past were black and impenetrable.  The aromas of the 2017 are finer, with some cedary French oak, red and darker berry fruits (RC, MB, BB, plum) as well as some fine spicy notes and a backdrop of menthol and eucalypt.  The palate is also finer, with a medium weight (as distinct from super full bodied) that has fine tannins, good acidity, fruits, spice and regional eucalypt notes and is eminently drinkable at this young age.  So diametrically opposed to the wines of old.  An interesting dichotomy.  The current wine is easy to drink and more to my current tastes, but I was a fan of those big Taltarni monsters in the deep distant past.  Visiting the Taltarni Cellar Door was a favourite in the area, alongside the Sunday Lunches at the Moonambell Pub.  Great memories come flooding back.
vivino	US	Hard to Find Lolea	11 June 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	We had trouble finding the red and white polka dot bottle of Red Sangria Frizzante called Lolea: it flies off the shelves where we live. Vivino carried it and not only was it discounted from the usual price we pay, but Vivino also gave us a new customer discount on top of that. We bought 2 cases and couldn't be happier and because of this, we will be buying from Vivino in the future.

vivino	US	Everything went well	05 June 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Everything went well. Easy to do and shipped to your door. Two observations I would like to state.1. For some reason it took an intervention from Vino to get the seller to step up and get order shipped.2. You are forced to sit and wait for delivery. You have to sign for the package. That wasted my day as I was following tracking online it gave me the day and time window it would arrive. The times were 11:00 am - 3:45 pm Delivery was at 4:00 pm so there was a day spent trapped at home.This was my first purchase so, only will order again if a great price is offered otherwise will pick up my wine at local store.

vivino	US	Fast and easy	30 May 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Fast and easy. I found the wines that I wanted to be cheaper than store bought, so I ordered several bottles. The packaging was great. No bottles broken. The whole process was fast and easy

vivino	US	Not happy	29 May 2022	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	Not happy.  Reason:  I ordered 9 bottles, somehow my shipment was separated and I received 1 bottle a few days ago and now am scheduled to receive the remaining 8 four days from now (in very hot weather).
vivino	US	I hope that my experience is unusual	29 May 2022	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	I hope that my experience is unusualI bought a mixed case of wines. It was my first order. Half of the order shipped, and was supposed to have arrived today. UPS tells me it will now arrive on Tuesday. The other half was cancelled because the wine was not actually available from the vendor. As I look for other wines that I know that I like, they do appear on Vivino, but they are not available through Vivino. So far it has been a less than inspiring experience.
vivino	US	Essential for remote living	28 May 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I live in a small northeastern city in Maine and am over 2 1/2 hours drive  to a decent wine retailer. Vivino has access to many of my favorite Italian wines and with free shipment, is a wonderful deal. After my initial order, I am very pleased with the service.
vivino	US	Always looking for a good deal‚Ä¶.	28 May 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Fast ship and great price. Would absolutely recommend and use again. Tried these wines at a tasting and found them here for a great price. Arrived on my doorstep 4 days later.

Dry good and I was able to get a wine I couldn‚Äôt find on other sites. Most recently my shipment arrived with one broken bottle. (It happens!). Customer service addressed the issue quickly and I received a credit within 24-36 hours. Can‚Äôt ask for more than that!
vivino	US	Good wine but poor delivery service.	23 May 2022	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	Good wine but poor delivery service. They had a hard time with delivery. Told them address 3 separate times via email and phone conversation but they kept getting undeliverable from delivery service. Eventually it was delivered, very frustrating process
vivino	AU	Wine deliveries have been great in the‚Ä¶	23 May 2022	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	Wine deliveries have been great in the past but unfortunately Australia Post really let the team down with my latest delivery which i have still not received 3 weeks later.  I did make a postcode error but Australia Post were most unhelpful in sorting it out. Hopefully i eventually get my order.
vivino	US	Resolved issue	22 May 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I ordered 6 bottles of Sinegal 2014 red wine from Vivino. When UPS gave me the package, I opened it immediately and realized that the bottles were abnormally hot, I would even say very hot. the wine was delivered to me at the end of the afternoon and therefore spent the whole day in the UPS Truck which is not air-conditioned.I immediately put the bottles in the wine cellar and forgot about them for a while. One day, I decided to open a bottle to savor this excellent wine. Alas, what was my surprise, when I realized that the wine was cooked. Normal, because it had spent the whole day in an non air-conditioned truck and in the city of Miami where the heat is stifling.I sent an email to Vivino informing them of the issue and they immediately replied apologizing for the problem. I asked them if I could return back the damaged wine bottles to them. They said no, but that I don't care because they would reimburse me for each damaged bottle and they advised me to open all the bottles and therefore try if the wine is drinkable.Unfortunately, all the wine was cooked and therefore unfit for consumption. Immediately, they refunded me the price of 4 bottles and gave me a coupon for 2 more bottles. With this coupon, I bought 6 bottles of Ribera del Duero Arzuaga 2018, arrived in very good condition and the wine is excellent.Vivino has the best customer service in this area. Serious, efficient, fast, honest and very kind. Buy with confidence, I recommend it.
vivino	US	Orders from Vivino	21 May 2022	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	I have ordered from Vivino 3 times now.  Each time the wines were received in good order.  The only complaint I have is their shipping and arrival dates are very confusing.  Fed Ex says one thing and Vivino says another.  They get here, but I just don't exactly know when that is going to be.

My husband and I were traveling so when I placed the order, I asked for a delayed delivery.  I received a response that it would be delivered at the later date I requested.  I then received notification that it would be delivered at the earlier original time.  I wrote multiple emails explaining that I needed it delivered later.  We were out of the country and could not make phone calls.  My emails were ignored.  The wine was ultimately sent back to the winery.  I would have loved to have tasted the wine.  This was a very frustrating situation.

vivino	US	Ordering a Breeze, Great Deal, delivery a bit of a worry...	03 May 2022	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	Vivino made us a great offer and we picked out three wonderful bottles by one of our favorite producers.  Shipping was really fast and both Vivino and their carrier in our part of Florida kept us aware of upcoming delivery details.  However, we couldn't be home ALL DAY to sign for the package as we're advised only of the day and full range of daylight hours carrier might make the attempt.  As luck would have it we were both away the one hour driver made the attempt.  We then asked carrier to leave the package the following day at their closest HOLD AT LOCATION.  Our experience with this redirected alternate delivery works well and tracking information advises me when I can can go pickup my redirected package.  However, this time the carrier's driver did not correctly enter my package in his delivery device and he completed the redirect as a package coming to the HOLD AT LOCATION store site, not as a package to be picked up by the carriers residential customer.  So, what I received was a tracking event advising my package had been delivered and was signed for by a total stranger to me.  Alarmed that there was a chance the carrier had just totally messed up my delivery I rushed to the HOLD AT LOCATION retail site where my carrier leaves packages for residential redirects and was relieved to find that they did have my carton of wine.  The tracking info I should have recieved was an altert advising me I could proceed to the HOLD AT LOCATION retail site I instructed the Carrier to alternate deliver to and pick up my package.  That didn't happen. So, a bit of coaching on how to record and document HOLD AT LOCATION service would be in order.  Thank you.

vivino	US	Horrible customer service !I have had the most frustrating‚Ä¶	21 April 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I have had the most frustrating experience with this company at every levels. After 5 weeks the wine paid for was still not delivered . At least 7 calls were made all answered by representatives in the Philippines who were always polite but never resolved the problem by finding out form  when the wine would be received. The last telephone conversation again said they would get back to me but again no response and when I do get one there is no specific information like a tracking number provided. The wine was supposed to be a birthday present and it has caused ongoing frustration for both me the purchaser and receiver. For all of the delays, the most they offered was a 10 percent discount on the next order. Why would I purchase anything from them again. The wine has still not been received. Ordered March 14, still not received by April 21 with at least 7 attempts by me to try to resolve the problem.

I ordered 10 assorted bottles of wine, and when they arrived they were so carefully laid in egg-crate type, but strictly designed for packing bottles.  There was no breakage, how could there have been with such expert packing.  I will be sure to tell my friends about Vivino and the simplicity of having them ship to your home...no more carrying heavy breakable bottles home when you can ship to your doorstep.  Great job...thank you.kaysunlakes

vivino	US	Vivino? Just say NO!	16 March 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I'm being generous to give Vivino even 1 star, my rating should be zero or a negative number. In January, I ordered 2 bottles of 2012 Dom Perignon, for a total of $382.50, which seemed like a good price. I asked them to delay shipment of the wine due to cold weather, which they did until 2/28. The package arrived a few days later. When I opened it a few days after that, was shocked to see no DP at all, just 2 bottles of a nothing-much Napa cab that I did NOT order. Contacting Vivino about this, they only offered to let me 'keep' this wine (which I did not order) plus $100 in store credit. When I rejected that offer, they upped it to $383 in store credit. But why would I accept store credit from a merchant that is so unreliable? Any reputable merchant would offer me a FULL refund in this situation. My only option now is to dispute the charge with my bank and hope for the best. Think twice before dealing with this bunch, they are obviously less than reputable.

She said she would email me, and she was quick about that too! I ended up with one more question, and she emailed me right back! Her information was so helpful that I had no concerns about placing my first order. The wine arrived very quickly with no problems. Overall, this was an easy, pleasant experience because of the absolutely excellent service! I would highly recommend Vivino, and I will be back when I need to purchase more.

vivino	US	A bust	13 March 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	The wine I ordered I have in my cellar from a previous purchase direct from the producer.  This wasn't that.  I am chalking this up to poor storage.  May want to focus on quality control on storage, etc. from the third party vendors because unfortunately vivino's name is tarnished by the vendors shortcomings.  This experience likely stops me from using vivino in the future.

vivino	CA	Disappointed	21 February 2022	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	Second time ordering from Vivino. First time I had to call and find out where my shipment was only to find out they had not sent it. They apologized and sent it quickly.This time I ordered 6 bottles and it took quite some time to get and it was delayed. I accepted reasonable delays due to general shipping challenges because of covid.The shipment arrived today Feb 21st, ordered January 26th. Upon arrival 4 of the bottles have the cork extruding from the bottles. I contacted and they offered a store credit and a suggestion I only re-order when the weather improves. Eventually they offered a refund. After receiving an email saying my refund has been processed (may take upto 5-7 business days) they sent a coupon for 10% off my next purchase with a maximum of $100.I contacted them through their on line chat service. Agent was apologetic and professional.Why was wine shipped to begin with if they are suspect of poor weather conditions this time of year? Store credit offered for the 4 bottles?Refund sent with a 5-7 day delay?10% coupon on next purchase?The right thing to do was to send 6 new bottles, as the confidence I have in the other two bottles is low.Very disappointed.

Because its alcohol law requires that an adult accept the delivery from UPS (or so I thought)1. I wasn't home when UPS tried to deliver  the wine2. Called UPS to arrange for pickup. Paid an extra $7.99 to UPS for me to pickup the package between 8 pm and 8:30 pm. 3. Arrived for pickup at 7:55. No way to pick up from 8 - 8:30 pm at UPS. Security guard said the truck shows up between 8 and 8:30 pm. Called UPS Customer Service 3 times and I waited until 9:30 pm. Truck never showed up.4. Called customer service and rerouted package to my friend's home who is home all day.5. UPS put the $100 worth of 2 bottles of wine in the mailbox so they froze. UPS did not ring her doorbell. UPS did not check identification to make sure the recipient was over 21.6. UPS still hasn't refunded the $7.99 in fees for me to pick up my package at their shipping center.Vivino needs to switch to FedEx or another service.

A lot of the wines do not match the reviews, 'dry' 4+ rated wines were far too sweet to drink and unlike other wine sellers it seems there is no way to get a refund on any wines that you don't like. So doubt I'll risk buying from vivino again.

vivino	US	My issue with my first order	14 January 2022	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	My issue with my first order from Vivino is that the seller took 20 days to deliver my case of wine after offering shipping in 48 hours.  After the first week someone from Vivino emailed me saying they were looking into the delay in shipping, but several more days past before I ever go any update.  I was hoping to have the wine for a New Year's gathering, but the wine didn't make it until January 9th.  As a gesture Vivino offered me a 10% off coupon code for my trouble.  I am not sure that that will sway me into ordering again anytime soon. (especially from that vendor)

However this is a 2018, so we are laying the 2nd bottle down for a few more years, and will decide then if it was worth the splurge.

vivino	US	Your website is very good and friendly‚Ä¶	28 December 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	"Your website is very good and friendly to use, but the cart for me was somewhat confusing.  Buying different selections apparently means they may come from different sources?  So, at one point when I had selected an even dozen, I really had six from one source and six from another?  In my mind you're an online expeditor and have no inventory under your control.  So in one of my recent orders, I received the wrong merchandise.  I received Chardonnay for Cabernet Sauvignon, winemaker being the same.  Ultimately, I was very pleased as I was instructed to keep the wine without any charge.  Unfortunately for everyone there was just not a way to make it ""right"" where I would have received what I ordered.  The supplier must not have had in stock what I originally ordered."

(Online and off line)I do think a lot on how they rate the wine.This wine that I purchased (6 bottles)  was for my guest at our Christmas gathering.  I opened 1 bottle so they can have a taste or a glass or few . I was flabbergasted when I saw that so little of the wine was taken.We must of went through 8 bottles but 1 glass of yours was almost left untouched.  You has it advertised with Majid Door Cab 2018 which I do have a few cases.   I would not recommend your store what so ever.  Roger

vivino	JP	I am very very disappointed by my‚Ä¶	16 December 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	"I am very very disappointed by my recent ""purchase"". I of course realize that Vivino is a confederacy of many vendors, but my recent order went to Somm in California. They had offered a fine Cotes de Nuits 1ere Cru at a good price. When the box arrived, it did not contain the wine it was labeled (on the inside of the box, even) to hold, which was David Duban's Nuits-Saint-Georges 1ere Cru ""Les Pruliers"" for which I paid $99.99 a bottle but instead had Roger Belland's Chassagne-Montrachet Morgeot-Clos Pitois 2018 which Vivino advertises at $74.99 a bottle. I opened complaint Case 00681498 and got a refund or $75.12 for the 3-bottle difference. But NOW I have discovered that $74.99 is a higher than average price for this Beaune wine, whereas the Nuits wine was offered at a bargain price lower than market. This is nothing but a bait-and-switch chisel. It is shameful that Vivino is subjected to this kind of thing. I think you should pay for a return of the wine that was sent and either send me the wine I ordered and paid for, or return my money! The responsibility lies with Somm, not with Vivino, but restitution is needed!"

vivino	ES	Delays on every order, bad service	15 December 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	My first ever order was heavily delayed, and only placed a second one because I was offered a good deal after the initial issues. Now, third order, issues yet again. Expected delivery date 3rd of December, it is now the 15th and I have received the information that it will be ‚Äúdelivered today‚Äù on 5 separate occasions, but no wine has showed up. I contacted support after more than 10 days of waiting past the expected delivery date, and the response was to book a new delivery for Friday, adding several days of further delays. I am also fairly certain that it will in fact not be delivered then as every time that they have promised a delivery, they have failed to show up, so I guess another week passes without my delivery. Since the support agent changed the delivery, without consulting me first, I can also no longer collect it at a pick up point, which I was willing to do to ensure I got the delivery, so the ‚Äúsupport‚Äù I received was further delays and making sure I can‚Äôt collect it myself to speed things up. Great. I responded and mentioned that this ‚Äúsolution‚Äù wasn‚Äôt acceptable and asked for them to come up with another solution, to which they responded with what was pretty much a copy paste of the first message. No personal touch, no empathy, and screwing it up further. Vivino gets 1/5 and their support gets -5/5, this was truly the last time I ever spent my hard earned money with this company, and I strongly recommend no one else does either. Go support your local wine boutiques and wine bars instead where you get some decent service.Edit: In the end I demanded that the agents manager call me to discuss the matter, few hours later I received a call from the agent himself where he was nonchalant and unhelpful as ever. Absolutely no way I could talk to a superior, no no, not in a million years. Offered no other solution, wait to see if I might get it in a few days time, or cancel and wait forever for a refund after paying and waiting a whopping 3 weeks. Thanks Vivino. Never ever shopping with you again, and neither should anyone reading this.Edit after reply: These people are liars and scammers. On all public forums they claim to be following up and being in contact with me, this is however a lie to deceive people into thinking they have existing support. After the 2 day delay they added, the parcel is not being delivered today either as promised. And complete radio silence since then from them. Liars, scammers, never ever ever spend your money here.

vivino	GB	Check the Shipping Address every time	10 December 2021	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	I‚Äôve used Vivino a fair bit over the last 2 years and been very pleased with the service. The Vivino star rating system gives me the confidence I need to bluff my way with guests. I hope it is bona fide and not influenced by sellers. Recently I have had a problem when I sent a crate to a sick friend (since sadly deceased) when all subsequent orders kept shipping to his address. This happened when I lazily bought straight from Apple Pay rather than going via checkout where I would have seen the incorrect shipping address. When you gift through Amazon the shipping address automatically reverts to the owner, but not Vivino via Apple Pay. It could have been embarrassing with the widow. Fortunately I spotted it via the order confirmation email and Vivino were quick to correct.

(I Haven‚Äôt heard back from customer services, despite attempts to contact them.)Upon subscription payment was taken immediately and so I assumed that I would receive the 12 bottles of wine promptly to enjoy over the coming 12 weeks. However it seems from the app, that my next shipment isn‚Äôt due until 22nd February. (12 weeks time).At which point Vivino will have taken the second payment for the next batch in May, another 12 weeks, meaning I‚Äôll have paid for 24 bottles by the time I receive 12. I feel as though I‚Äôve signed up for a gym membership that I can‚Äôt use until payment has been taken for the second month.

I had to cancel my first purchase due to an unresponsive seller, wait 3 weeks for my next order (it shipped 10 days after purchase and took almost two weeks to arrive). The wine was also corked. Poured out three entire Bordeaux bottles. I‚Äôm currently waiting for my third order after asking twice for it to be cancelled since it hadn‚Äôt shipped. Instead, it was shipped anyway (a week. after it was ordered) and I have a shipping number that says it won‚Äôt arrive for another 10 days.

Im actually not sure it was Malbec. Definitely different and more akin to a Merlot than a Malbec. Did they bottle the wrong wine. We don't drink Merlot! but now have 5 bottles
vivino	AU	Disappointing Delivery Experience	17 November 2021	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	Disappointing Delivery ExperienceI know that the extremely late delivery of the wine is to do with Apost, however, the way you have handled it has not been impressive . . . to say the least.Firstly your suggesting to me that it my responsibility to chase Apost rather than yours is disappointing . . . you chose them to deliver your products. Other wine suppliers we use, use other more reliable delivery services.Secondly last Friday you sent me a message that the wine has been delivered. It still has not! Only half has been delivered.Are you going to follow-up with Apost? Do you intend to handle this better?

vivino	US	I am a new customer to Vivino	13 November 2021	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	I am a new customer to Vivino.  The first two orders were excellent, however encountered problems with the 3rd order.  The reason for not meeting expectation is after 4 days the issue is still unresolved having talked to Vivino and emailed several times about the shipment issue.  If this issue had not occurred or was resolved as promised my review would be 5 stars.  I believe it is Vinvinos responsibility to manage their fulfillment partners and their issues in a prompt manner.

I then had to search on Google to find a nearby postal code that the system would accept , which then proved a challenge for the delivery company :(I had to process the credit card payment twice before the system accepted it, even though the second time the system accepted the same details it rejected on the first attempt :( Events like that discourage potential purchasers.

vivino	GB	First Vivino order (edited)	25 October 2021	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	Ordered my first box of wine from Vivino. I bought enough to meet the free delivery threshold but received an email from the Vivino team informing me that one of the wines I ordered was only available in a different vintage. I said no problem, but it turned out they had actually run out of the wine I had ordered altogether. As a result my order value was reduced and I didn't qualify for free delivery. I was paying nearly the same amount in total for less wine so contacted Vivino and was told they'd honour the free delivery and the correct amount would be taken from my account. The money left my account more than two weeks ago now and I still haven't received a refund of the delivery amount. Meanwhile Vivino seem to have stopped responding to my emails. Pretty poor really.EDIT: Vivino quickly replied to this review and then my last email. I received the refund a day or two later. Rating increased to 4 stars.

The wine was sent quickly and arrived securely packed. So far 5 STARS for the experience. However the incessant daily marketing emails since have led me to subtract two stars.
vivino	GB	Good Service, Loads of Emails	17 October 2021	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	Decent amount of choice at reasonable prices. Postage price acceptable too, as certainly could not justify spending the amount required to get this free.Downside is the significant amount of emails received. Unfortunately fell foul of the 'verify your email address', as I thought this was to complete the purchase, but clearly it was to either sign up, or allow continued bombardment with emails.Whilst it would be easy to block the address, i might purchase from this company again, but only if I want a particular wine.

They assured me they were looking into it. Finally now in the middle of October I have cancelled the order and requested my money back. They never explained the reason for the failure to deliver. Very bad service!
vivino	GB	Vivino need to drop ParcelForce	15 October 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	The latest debacle is it is now the 15th October 2021 and I have still not received my order from Vivino that I placed on the 1st October. I love Vivino, but I hate their delivery partner ParcelForce in the UK. They have a policy that you have to sign for wine, which is impossible for most people these days, so it just keeps going back and forth to the depot. I have left explicit instructions where to leave it in a secure place, but they rigidly stick to the policy. NO OTHER wine company I deal with uses ParcelForce for this reason and no other delivery company insists on a signature either. I get deliveries every week from Hermes, DPD, UBS, FEDEX, YODEL etc and none of them make their customers jump through hoops. So for all of you out there suffering the same problem, they way round it is to continue use Vivino's wine recommendations and order the wine from someone else. Such a shame as otherwise I think Vivino are great.
vivino	US	I ordered three bottles of the same‚Ä¶	13 October 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I ordered three bottles of the same wine and only received one. I have contacted the Vino to find out if I will be receiving the other two bottles from my purchase and I have yet to hear anything. Very disappointed
vivino	US	Room For Improvement	13 October 2021	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	"The concept of identifying and offering wines at favorable prices is certainly the highlight of the site.  Conversely, I found that ordering several wines at the same time is a bit cumbersome.  In my most recent experience, I realized that the ""best price"" may be from a local distributor and Vivino orders cannot (easily?) be mixed and matched in one single transaction.  However, in this particular case, I was disappointed to find that when I tried to order a second wine from he same distributor during the same transaction, the price of the second wine was higher than that advertised on Vivino (I even made sure vintage was same)."

vivino	GB	Switch of vintage - Bad customer service	13 October 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I have previously ordered from Vivino. I ordered a case of wine based on the vintage and when they arrived they were a different vintage. I contacted them and they said the supplier just switched them.  I have been continually annoyed by the one person customer service lack of consideration and the number of days it takes for emails to be responded to. I arranged for collection and moved my days around to accommodate collection. They did not turn up!! I could not get through to CS and another email sent. I have been a big fan of this organisation (recommending it) and now believe that something has changed. I have deleted the app and will never purchase from them as believe they have lost control of their business and have inadequate CS person dealing with issues. I strongly recommend not to order from Vivino as this is not normal business behaviour.
vivino	US	Vivino was great at shipping the wine- wine is ok	12 October 2021	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	Vivino was great at shipping the wine. I just think it's not as fantastic as it was touted to be.

But when the order arrived it was a different vintage. They put in a note indicating they are sending me a different vintage, so it's not a mistake. But in that case, I should have been contacted before they shipped something I didn't order. It feels a bit like bait and switch.

Contacted customer service to submit the messages, no response from customer service rep. Orders shipped without guest messages.Followed up with customer service again, was given a credit for one order and thanked for ""helping us identify a issue in our systems and in our customer service training."" Beyond that, lack of empathy and understanding how much time I had had to spend on this issue was infuriating. Didn't appreciate being dismissed with the credit. Thanks for the thanks, but as a customer I shouldn't be thanked for helping you all recognize your own problems.Was a regular customer of Vivino prior; will not be buying with Vivino after this experience and my issue being so readily dismissed."
vivino	DK	WARNING: Vivino is making customers pay for their own mistakes!	08 October 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	"Original post:I was scrolling Vivinos site and found a very good (at least I thought) offer. I placed an order of 12 bottles of this wine, and had my order confirmed shortly after. The next day Vivino customer ""service"" contacted me on email to let me know they had to decline my order, due to the price of the wine was wrong on their website. They said that if I wanted the wine then I had to pay more than double the price I already paid (another offer). Instead of paying for their own mistake on their website Vivino wanted me, their customer, to pay for their wrong pricing. Of course I declined the new offer.Vivino then declined my original order and gave me a 10% discount code if I came back as customer in the same month, but with at max value of ~10 eur (75 dkk) which is laughable compared to my original order.This is sadle not my first BAD experience with Vivino (read my other review), but definitely my last!UPDATE. Answer:An almost 50% discount is NOT a generous offer, when it's still three times more expensive than the original price. Paying for the expense when making a mistake as a company is a generous offer.And writing as a response that the price on your website was obviously low is like pointing the fault back at me as customer as if I wanted to take advantage of the situation... by ordering TWO boxes (???)That's a new low for customer service. Sorry to have been a part of it."

I was hoping there was a way to know that pricing or invoice would not be in the box as it was sent as a gift. I called the supplier and they assured me the cost is not listed. I also would have liked to have included a note or card so the recipient knew who sent the wine. Is there a way of adding notes when placing an order?I will definitely use again.

Other wine companies I have ordered from the wine was always cold when it arrived.  In the past some of the ice packs were so large and not even began to melt.  I would have paid more to have my wine come cold. The company replied to my complaint and gave me a $6 credit for the ""ice packs""."

The substituted a 2019 without calling me to notify the vendor didn‚Äôt have 2017 anymore.I called to ask why they wouldn‚Äôt have notified me.  They just apologized. I spoke with Moira and Roberto, both stating they would email me to provide the notes of the wine and whether, being so young, it would be flavorful to drink.Roberto asked that I taste it, and if I didn‚Äôt like it, they would fully refund.  I asked for an email, and still have not received anything from Roberto.Take your money and shop where there‚Äôs integrity and strong CS.
vivino	US	Get a little bit	05 October 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	We downloaded this app at first to help us rate and buy wines from our local stores that fit our taste. The app worked great, for that and we liked Vivino. Then we would see recommendations come to us for similar wines within similar price and rating ranges. I enjoyed that feature and liked Vivino a little more. I found myself searching for some of the recommendations (which was fun) and found a few, and we enjoyed them. As I grew more and more comfortable with the app and by this time the website, I placed an order for some wine. The delivery was relatively fast (a couple days) and the prices for decent well rated wine was conveniently at our door, and we enjoyed Vivino a lot more. I've now ordered several times and truly find the service to be an efficient, convenient, economic and enjoyable experience. Thank You Vivino !!

vivino	SE	Vivino- good wine offer but a lousy delivery service by BUDBEE	28 September 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Vivino has a very good offer. However in Sweden they use the scandalous delivery service via BUDBEE. Budbee lies to me as client, they crush bottles and over the summer they have missed out on delivery at several occasions. They apologize but it is worth nothing when they do the same after a few days again.Vivino should sort this out, and kick them out.

Unfortunately, Fedex delayed shipment an extra day, leaving the champagne sitting in a non-refrigerated environment for 24+ hours. (Our temps are still in the upper 80's here.) It did arrive on my husband's birthday, but was completely flat.  No noise at all from the cork, hardly any bubbles in the bubbly.  Very disappointing.

Please be aware that they do not ship to all states and their advertised wines and vintage are not always available.  Also, they send out emails and sometimes the product is already sold out.  Despite these flaws, it is a good go-to for wine.

vivino	US	Not thrilled	21 September 2021	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	My Vivino shopping experience was more like 5 stars, but the actual wine dealer was less than great.  They offered an option for 6 ice packs, which I added to my cart for $12. When I received my package, there were 1 or 2 tiny Ice packs (3 x 5 inches) per layer of packed wine.  Obviously they were completely melted a week later when I got the wine.  Total ripoff.  Additionally, one of the bottles of wine had one of the labels missing.  I give these as gifts and cannot give this one for that reason.

Wine was not packaged with ice packs like the other outlets.  One of the bottles had damage on the capsule (the most expensive bottle of course), like liquid had spilled on it.  It is not clear if the wine is in condition or not, as I will not be consuming the wine purchased for awhile.  The wine did arrive, and Vivino support was very helpful tracking the order and informing me of the shipping delay.

The ordering process was simple and I was kept up to date throughout the shipping process.  I have ordered wine through shipments before so I knew but a word of caution.

My credit card indicated that ForWineLovers charged my card.  I thought I was being scammed.  Vivino needs to be clear and up front that that is how it works.  It may have been there but I did not see it.   I asked ForWineLovers why they were charging my card....got a response...asking for my name which I gave and then they NEVER returned a reply.   At least Vivino sent me an email a few days later saying that they are looking at why the order had not yet shipped.  It took over a week to get the wine.  On the positive side, the wine was packaged very well and the wine is excellent!!

On my second order from Vivino, I received a leaking (wet) ""corked"" bottle of wine. They sent the wine by UPS AND THE WINE ARRIVED HOT AND LEAKING. I immediately asked Vivino what I needed to do (send it back, etc.) to receive a refund, and I sent multiple pictures of the situation. Vivino responded 7 days later by claiming they were processing a refund of the money I spent on the 2 spoiled bottles. I have waited 8 business days since then and still no refund. Order from these clowns at your your own peril. Later I found that all 5 bottles I ordered had leaked."

I don't buy wine without your app's advice.  I'm certain it has made my wine tasting experience far richer and more diverse while saving me money by not buying wines I would not enjoy so much.Just a couple of weeks ago I purchased 2 bottles of Thurlow Cabernet from you.  I wanted to be certain of their care so I paid extra to have a cold pack put into their well packed box.  Unfortunately, the wine took at 5 days to arrive and it was warm to the touch when I opened it.  I don't claim to be an expert, but I understand higher temperatures are not so good for wine.

vivino	US	Everything went well with delivery	16 August 2021	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	Everything went well with delivery. The only disappointment  was that I was charged $6 to add ice to the package just to make sure the wine would not get too warm, the ice was a $2 item. So I think $6 was a bit too much.
vivino	US	I ordered this allegedly special wine‚Ä¶	16 August 2021	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	I ordered this allegedly special wine based upon Vvino's reputation & my past orders.  However, Once I received it, I looked it up on your Vivino app and it said it was available for $50.  I feel like I've been taken advantage of.  Also, when you look up the actual wine pitched, the label appears different so I am confused and feel like I have wasted about $420, since I apparently could've purchased the same thing for $50 v. $120/bottle.  Confused & disappointed,Jerry Starkey, longtime customer of Vivino

vivino	US	Excellent experience with Vivino	15 August 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Don‚Äôt know why i did not buy from Vivino sooner. This was one of the smoothest transactions ever. Beautiful Super Tuscan I could not find anywhere and at a very good price. Excellent communication from the company on the shipping process. The case came professionally boxed.

However your shipping method leaves a lot be improved. The first shipment I received I paid extra for temperature control and the cold pack was very warm as was the wine.

She had no idea where the order is or when it will be here. They also cannot apparently even find out anything until the order is moved from the first carrier to the second one. She did apologize that my expectations were not within reason...I stated that my expectations are based on their website and their shipping and delivery standards! Not a reliable company. Won't order again. Will be cancelling my order tomorrow if I don't receive the update I was promised.

vivino	US	This seems like a great app at first	02 August 2021	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	This seems like a great app at first.  But of our first three confirmed orders (yes, confirmed) two have been delayed and I am suspicious won't be delivered.I can't combine multiple purchases on one order... each has it's own (high) freight cost.Finally, we were given a 20% coupon because of delayed orders and after we'd placed a significant order and had provided credit card information we got a notice that said the coupon couldn't be used with that vendor.  So I cancelled the order.After high hopes at first we're realizing that other than providing lots of junk email this is proving to be somewhat limited.  Great idea.  Average execution.

vivino	GB	No customer support and shocking fulfilment	27 July 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Absolutely no customer care or support whatsoever. They emailed me when I had ordered to proclaim their 24 hour express delivery and 4 days later, no wine. Not only no wine but no reply to any emails enquiring about my wine order. Then, when the wine finally turns up so does a rude and aggressive delivery driver representing their company. All in all....a pretty shocking experience but no one at Vivino appears to care, at all.
vivino	US	This app is genius	26 July 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	This app is genius. It makes life easy and removes the chance of buying wines that you havent tasted and may not like. Now if the favorite Reisling was on sale I would be truly pleased

In looking at the case I believe the packaging needs improvement.  A bump on the side broke the bottle.  I elected not to return the whole case since I wanted the wine for a party  I had the Fed-Ex delivery man make note in his files but I suspect thats the last ill hear about it & I'll likely absorb the cost of the loss.

vivino	US	Terrible	15 July 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	It took weeks to finally receive my order and once it did arrive, it was not my order but rather someone else's.  I was then told a few days later that the wine I had ordered was not available.  Incredible that it took that long to realize they couldn't fulfill my order.  I subsequently ordered my wine from another vendor and received it within two days!

vivino	US	I love this app	13 July 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	"I love this app. I have always been able to read more about wines and also check pricing, etc. I have also ordered wines off of the app, especially when they have coupon offerings which makes the pricing even that much better for wines I cannot find in my local area. Overall, the app is easy to use and I enjoy looking back at past wines and remembering to order it again or simply remembering the ""when"" and ""where"" I had those wines!"

I cancelled the order as they suggest supplying at higher price!!!!No refund received, so I chase them. I am told they have only refunded half (still not received) and have shipped half (which I told them I did not want as I sourced elsewhere).Now, they want me to arrange to refuse the delivery (I am not due to be at home when it will arrive), then wait another 10 days for refund.Never again!

vivino	US	Horrible shipping and nonexistent support	12 July 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I placed an order with Vivino and it got lost for over 2 weeks. Their support took multiple days between responses, and every response was just a canned message telling me they wouldn't be able to help. Eventually I received by wine by constantly calling FedEx and asking for updates, but Vivino did absolutely nothing to assist in the situation. I will skip the middle man and order directly from a wine store next time, never again through Vivino.

vivino	US	Shocked At Such Great Service	11 July 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	My hats off to Pascale's Liquor Square for shipping me my favorite wine all the way to Arizona.  I lived in Syracuse NY for many years and was a regular customer of their store all of that time.  Upon moving to Arizona, I was unable to get my favorite Chianti until now.  Aside from needing a heavier grade box, the wine arrived in perfect condition and I am enjoying it immensely!  Thank you very much for your efforts and I will most certainly be ordering again soon!.

I have called customer service twice and was told it was being shipped from California.I told them that was unacceptable as it has already been 10days and this wine will be spoiled by the time it arrives by cargo van in 100 degree heat. By the way I live in Ma and didn‚Äôt expect my wine to travel cross country in a van. Customer service has told me twice they will check into this shipment but so far no response.

vivino	GB	Great App - Environmentally unfriendly packaging	05 July 2021	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	Firstly I think the Vivino app is first class. I use it all the time to assess wines and more often than not it is very reliable. The reason I am only giving Vivino 3 stars is their use of excessive amounts of plastic in the delivery process. I will not be ordering from Vivino in the future. For the second time my wine has been delivered in an oversized box with each bottle protected in an individual plastic bubble. The amount of plastic used is frankly unacceptable. I was advised after the first delivery that it was a mistake but that is clearly not the case.
vivino	US	Love this app	04 July 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Love this app! So great to see how wines are rated and reviews.  I ordered 6 bottles of wine.

I am so impressed and will use Vivino much more! love it! Thank you!

vivino	US	Expensive wine arrived late after being‚Ä¶	30 June 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Expensive wine arrived late after being delayed twice for two additional days was and was very warm to the touch upon arrival. I considered sending it back because I had no idea how long the wine had been sitting in a truck in Texas at 90+ degrees.  Expensive wine gets cooked if it sits for days in a closed truck sitting in the Texas sun.So, I wont be using the app to order wine again.  Slow and delayed delivery + lack of proper packaging = no more business from me.

So then I was offered the option to purchase a different vintage for $4.00 more per bottle. On a positive note, I declined the option to purchase the different vintage but choose to receive the two bottles that were available.  Vivino immediately credited my card for the difference and I received my two bottles in 4 days.

vivino	US	For more than a Year I would read the‚Ä¶Experience With Vivino	21 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	For more than a Year I would read the emails received from Vivino almost daily. I read them as I was impressed with them.  I have my favorite wine and I saw it recently and purchased a case. it was a delightful simple experience thanks to Vivino.  Everything went smoothly and the Wine is great.  I'm looking forward to trying a number of new wines from them.  I felt so good about it I recommended it to three friends who are also wine drinkers and all of us are in a Gourmet Dinner Club together where we all take turn  doing dinner once a year and wine is part of the specialty.  Look out Vivino here we all come.  Thanks
vivino	US	Excellent Wine But Careless Handling and Delivery	21 June 2021	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	"The Wine is excellent and fairly priced. The order process was easy and efficient. My only disappointment was with the United Parcel Service Delivery. I was informed that ""the Wine was on the Delivery Truck and Out For Delivery"". Furthermore, that ""It Would Be Delivered By 7:00 PM That Day"". Well, unfortunately, it was on the HOT Delivery Truck ALL DAY. Not only that, but the Wine didn't arrive until 9:00 PM, was pretty warm and the enclosed Ice Pack had melted and dried out."
vivino	US	Vivino Works for Us	21 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	We have ordered from Vivino several times and have been pleased to have fast service. Vivino also gives us a way to keep track of wines we like (or don't!) and what we have ordered in the past.

vivino	US	Took over a week to get	21 June 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Took over a week to get. Left outside in 110-degree temperature. Boiled in the delivery truck ALL DAY. That's just what I know just one day of the wine care. Ordered 12 bottles received 11. Terrible packing. This is my second bad experience out of 2 and my last..
vivino	US	Ordered a case of wine	21 June 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	"Ordered a case of wine, first it took quite a while to confirm and ship, long enough the Vivino had to reach out to the merchant to see what the hold-up was.  Then I finally got a case of wine - just the wrong one.  Similar, but different.  Like if you order a Fuji apple from the grocery store and they just substitute a different red apple like you won't notice.Then there was a delay again while they figure out what to do - btw, at no point offering to  just refund it - although we may get there.  They only suggested that I keep the original packaging and then after another delay sent me a ""call tag"" to ship the wine back - again no offer of a refund (yet) and no confirmation that the merchant would cross ship the correct wine - and no response to questions about what would happen after I ship it back. I expect that eventually it will sort itself out - either I will get a refund or the correct wine... but I'm nearly a month in from the original transaction.I can only say that I had a totally different experience with wine.com where I was misshipped something.  A new bottle (on their cost) was on its way to me that day and they told me to just keep the one they had misshipped.  Their error, their cost.  This is, I think, the challenge with Vivino in that they are just the broker between the merchant and the customer and don't really have any control over the process (that I can tell).As an illustration of their disconnectedness, during the midst of this, the system sends me an email asking me to review them.  Might want to rethink that process...."

vivino	US	This is the first TERRIBLE experience I‚Ä¶	18 June 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	This is the first TERRIBLE experience I have had with Vivino.I purchased 2 cases of Rose that i needed to take on a trip, costing $496.  I only purchased as the website confirmed the exact date of delivery which would work for me prior to the trip.I received my email confirmation and tracking number.  On the day there was no information available via tracking other than confirming my address so i called Vivino and they said they'd look into it and get back to me within 24-hours.  I advised this was no good and i needed an answer as soon as they called their distributor as i needed the wine the day i was calling as i was leaving the following day.The operatives, whilst polite, clearly read from a script and have no idea how to navigate a query away from the script.  I called the Courier direct whom said the shipment was due for delivery the following week.!I called Vivino back and explained the predicament again.  The operative listened and we were disconnected, for which i believe the call simply dropped albeit this is rare!I called again and contacted a 3rd different operative and had to repeat a 3rd time all that had happened.  She didn't listen and said she'd look into it whilst i said that was no good - ii needed the 2-cases on the date they had confirmed which was today yet they were unable to track the delivery and the courier had confirmed it was scheduled for the following week.She said the delivery date was a guide and it could take 5-7 days.  No where on the website does it say this or i wouldn't have placed the order as i wsa on a fixed deadline for receipt.I was incensed and requested a cancellation and the $496 to be credited immediately to my account  She then said their distributor had dispatched the wine so they would have to receive it back and then they would refund me in 7-10 days time.She left me with my blood boiling and I cut them off.   $496 out of pocket and no wine so I was forced to go out to the local liquor store and purchase a different brand of Rose at a higher cost, in order to meet my deadline.After this terrible service I left my home the following morning with still only a $496 charge on my credit card, no refund and no wine only to receive a message from the courier some 2 hours later with a photo of 2 cases of wine left on my doorstep.... i am away from my home for 7-days!Terrible service on this occasion and appalling Customer Service with no action and no follow-up.  I've never heard from them since that 3rd call.So I've subsequently spent over $700 in wine to meet my reason for purchase and 2 cases are abandoned at my home.

vivino	US	The wine I ordered arrived quickly but hot.	17 June 2021	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	The wine I ordered arrived quickly. Shipping took 2 days. It was a small order. However, their was no cold pack in the shipment. It arrived warm to hot to the touch. Since the wine isn't recommended to be opened for at least another year, I won't know if the wine was ruined by the excessive heat for quite a while. If this is the way wine is shipped by Vivino then I will only be able to order from them in the winter.

vivino	US	Order Changed w/o Notice	16 June 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I ordered two bottles for the recipient and w/o any explanation to me, one of the bottles was cancelled from the order and an insufficient amount was refunded to my bank account.  I  had added  the ice pack because of the white pouilly fuisse that had been ordered.  You notified the recipient that the white had been cancelled and refunded, with no explanation and you have yet to tell me, but $27.xx has been refunded.  The red cabernet was received, there was no ice pack in the shipment - i assume because reds don't need chilling, or itwas forgotten.  Since the fuisse cost $22.XX, and ice pack is $6, refund should have benn $28.00, plus tax.   Looks like the ice pack refund has been omitted.  I would PLEASE have someone call me at 423-292-9392 and explain why the wine was cancelled and to confirm refund correction.  thanks - James (Jamie) Renfro

But, if you order several types of wine the $15 shipping from each vendor can really add up and distinguish any savings.

I still don't know where my other package is located. Upon arrival, and despite paying extra for ""ice packs"" the wine inside registered almost 90 degrees F.  I don't even know how long the wine was in this UPS truck at over 90F heat, and for how many days before it actually reached me.  I understand most importers ship wine in refrigerated containers to distributors, but what is the point if the wine gets damaged at the final destination point (the consumer). Hope I don't have cooked wine."

vivino	GB	First Ever Purchase from Vivino	04 June 2021	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	This was my very first purchase from Vivino, the process was easy and sufficiently straight forwards, I made the purchase based on promo's by Vivino,  the delivery was also fast and efficient, with the product extremely well packed.Not sure if I would purchase direct again, I might but? The but is trust, I say this as since my purchase there have been other offerings on two of the varietals I purchased, so it is all to do with the way offerings are presented and to be truthful I am not sure that I got such a good deal. In retail over relatively short periods of time pricing should remain stable to promote and develop customer confidence. The two varieties I refer to were not inexpensive so it has left me with a feeling of doubt.
vivino	US	Experience in Texas	03 June 2021	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	ordered the wine, received good emails on status tracking and the wine arrived when expected in a well packaged container.. since I'm in Texas I ordered the ice pack to help keep the heat away. .I should have had 2 ice packs The temps here were in the mid 80's so not so hot for Texas and I thought I would see how it goes.. But since it was a 7 day delivery in a  non cool transportation vehicle the ice pack was not cold anymore and the bottles were probably about 75-80 degrees. I haven't tasted any of the wines yet but hopefully they will be ok. I would use Vivino again but only order in the winter months here to be safe (Nov-March). If they provide a better cooling option then maybe other months.

Ordered a case of 6 bottles the same day and it arrived safely and well-packed (no charge for shipping) just 3 days later.  Will definitely use Vivino for wine purchasing again - and for gift shipping!  Thank you so much.
vivino	US	Vivino lied to me about the shipment‚Ä¶	17 May 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Vivino lied to me about the shipment date of my order and the delivery date of the order. They sent me a tracking number that did not give any tracking information as the order was not even being fulfilled. When I called to inquire about where the order was, I was told that this merchant systematically misinforms customers about shipping dates, telling them orders have shipped before knowing whether or not they can even fulfill the order. Vivino is aware of this practice and allows it to continue. This is a horrible way to treat customers - systematically lying to them. My shipment did not arrive in time for my mother's celebration of life event. Now Vivino thinks I'm interested in ordering through them again with a very small discount. No thanks.

vivino	US	Dishonest company	23 May 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Dishonest company. Tried to manipulate me after they failed to ship the product as promised. I canceled the order before the shipping and they made up a date to try to keep me from canceling. I refused the delivery when made. I would never use them. Buyer beware.Regarding your rebuttal, the wine delivery was refused and sent back to you. Still waiting on the refund as your company guarantee states. I have several emails of your colleagues stating and directing me to refuse the delivery and a full refund will be transacted. Another reason why your company is dishonest.

vivino	FR	False promises	10 May 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	False promisesAround Easter I received a barrage of advertisements on Facebook encouraging me to benefit from a 32% reduction on the price of selected New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc wines. Persuaded by this, I placed an order. But found the discount was non existent. The price I paid was the ‚Äòdiscounted‚Äô price that happens to me the ‚Äònormal‚Äô price that most other customers not buying through vivino also pay. The wine is excellent but Vivino has not been able to explain to me why a non existent discount was offered. I even sent a screenshot of the promotion to them but I have received no acknowledgment or reply. This is a dodgy practice. It is dishonest and misleading And as disappointing is their failure to acknowledge this abs give me an adequate response

The actual wine wasn't the same quality as I was used to. It was supposed to be sweet, almond flavours, but instead medium and very green. No almond at all, which was the best bit about the wine! Perhaps not a good year or the locals are keeping the good stuff!

To make matters worse, immediately after placing my order, I told a family member about this particular wine. They ordered the same vintage just after speaking with me. The family member received the correct vintage. I immediately contacted Vivino. I spoke with Loren who went above and beyond on my behalf. While I was very disappointed at the onset, Loren turned the situation around and provided a suitable option. Thank you for the excellent service and putting the customer first.

Well, this is Day 10 since it was placed. It was originally supposed to arrive April 28. You know, I was not even advised by the seller or Vivino that there would be a big delay. I had to inform Vivino the status had changed ion my tracking to waiting to receive item. Vivino then had to contact the seller, etc. So now I am told the box might actually be at the shipper by May 6 to start its journey. So, a big GOOSE EGG on that one. So that averages out to about 2.5 stars, I guess. But only if I actually get the box. Eventually.

vivino	TH	Do not buy premium wine from Vivino, they'll rip you off!	04 May 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I purchased a dozen Bass Philip pinot noir approximately 12 months ago and immediately cellared them. I recently took half a dozen to a private tasting evening and we all noted that the wine tasted off, clearly previously damaged by heat. I immediately notified Vivino who told me they would only accept it back within 14 days of purchase. I'm not sure who drinks premium wine within 14 days of purchase and certainly a merchant of premium wine should be prepared to acknowledge that damaged wine will only be noted at time of consumption which can sometimes be years after purchase. They have refused all reasonable requests from me and I have now referred their case to the ACCC.
vivino	US	Delivery Service Great / Product Awful	04 May 2021	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	Great service for delivery. Prompt and well packaged. Nothing was broken or messed up. The wine however was disgusting. I‚Äôve had many vintages of the Sapporo product and this was nowhere near the quality that I‚Äôm used to. It is drinkable but not good.
vivino	US	I bought two hyped wines with high expectations...	03 May 2021	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	I bought two hyped wines, one of which I loved in previous vintages over a decade ago. Marketing was better than the wines, both of which were average at best. 2019 Lyeth Red Blend had jamminess of an inexpensive Syrah blended in. The 2016 Petite Cote was mostly Merlot and lacked any a finish. Disappointing! I must say that this experience was not consistent with past purchases, most of which have exceeded expectations.

vivino	US	There is no option to cancel an order	30 April 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	"I have used the app for years to view the prices of wine I want to buy, and that part of the app works beautifully. I decided to order from them for the first time yesterday, and what a joke. I searched for a wine, found it, placed an order, and then saw on my confirmation that the wrong bottle was ordered. I immedidately tried to cancel, and there IS NO WAY TO CANCEL! Their website states that if you cancel without 24 hours it's fine, but there is no option to cancel! I searched the web for how to cancel, and there are directions.  I followed those ""easy"" directions and found that the cancel option is not where it's supposed to be. When you CANNOT CANCEL AN ORDER, then you can never meet their 24 hour guidelines. You can also not call because there is no number. I will NEVER order from them again."

vivino	GB	Poor service	12 April 2021	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	I ordered 6 bottles of a favourite wine, which included free delivery. Only 5 were delivered and I was charged for delivery, making the bottles considerably more expensive, and not fulfilling my order! Despite emailing twice about this issue nobody has bothered to get back to me with any explanation, to send my missing bottle or a refund. A poor first experience, and will be my last.

vivino	US	I like the Vivino App and use it	11 April 2021	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	I like the Vivino App and use it. I like the price/selection of your offerings. The BIG problem is delivery. every time. My most recent purchase (last week) changed its delivery dates 3 times. And since I have to stay home to sign for the package, that's too much rearranging of my life. Makes use of your purchase offerings MUCH less attractive / unacceptable.

From time of order til delivery was 2 weeks which was too long especially since it was sent FEDEX, and therefore the only reason I didn't give a 5 star rating.   Hopefully, shipping times will be better next time.  The wine is awesome......
vivino	US	Easy to purchase wine at fair price	05 April 2021	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	Easy to purchase wine at fair price. However UPS/ FEDEX need to understand that they cannot throw the boxes around.

This was surprising given they are still selling my orignal wine and have 20 bottles in stock right now, just at an increased price?

vivino	US	I hope that my bad experience is unique!	02 April 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	"I hope that my experience is not the norm for Vivino. My order has been seriously mishandled by Vivino. I ordered Stewart wine (12 bottles) on Mar 7, 2021. On Mar 9, my credit card was charged for the full amount. According to the estimated delivery, the Vivino web site mentioned up to Mar 15 as the latest. I did not receive delivery and bought wine at Spec's instead for my big party on Mar 20.I contacted Vivino on Mar 22 to check on the problem of no delivery and no notice, was told that 2016 bottles were not available as ordered. I agreed to accept the substituted 2017 bottles (at a lower value). As of Mar 30, there is still no notice, and 23 days after ordering without delivery!! I finally asked for cancellation with a full refund. Nothing was done until I put the credit card amount in dispute with credit card company. I was then sent a notice from Vivino ""Your order has been cancelled. An error occured while fulfilling your order. Unfortunately, we were unable to process your order. If you notice a charge, it will be automatically refunded within 5-10 business days.""I know that Vivivo distributes wine through many merchants. In order to keep Vivino reputation, it needs to take care of issues like this in a swift manner with other merchants and get rid of affiliation bad ones. I will never order wine from Vivino again !!!!"
vivino	US	The app never asked for my shipping‚Ä¶	01 April 2021	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	The app never asked for my shipping address but somehow the transaction was processed. No shipping/tracking info was provided. The app says wine was delivered to the address of my credit card which cover acres of roads and space. The workflow is seriously broken.I have found the case of wine. It was delivered to my company credit card address.  It appears to have been a problem with Google Pay and NOT with Vivino.

vivino	US	Your customer service representatives‚Ä¶	28 March 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Your customer service representatives are excellent, however the liquor stores you order from do not care what the order says, they will send out whatever they want to your customer.  I placed two orders and both orders were delivered wrong. I called one of the liquor stores directly and was given the excuse of computers not updating inventory, I asked why they chose to mail something I did not order through vivino...they had no answer.  So for that reason I have to unsubscribe from any further emails/orders from vivino.  The best part of your business is your customer service representatives, as I said, they were great!

vivino	US	Disappointing Release - Not Buttery	16 March 2021	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	"I am disappointed in this year's Gold Crush as compared to the 2016.  The 2016 was very buttery, but this release doesn't seem, to me, to have very much butter.  It tastes to have been made more in the ""modern"" style, which is more fruit forward than buttery.  It's still a nice chard, but not what I buy this one for.  There does seem to still be some 2016 available, so I may go looking for it."
vivino	US	Suggestion..,unless it‚Äôs already in‚Ä¶	16 March 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Suggestion..,unless it‚Äôs already in place....consider having a ‚Äúfind my wine‚Äù section on your app. Let the user input certain criteria ( Cabernet, dark fruit , semi acidic, etc..maybe even cost parameters ..$39-$50). Then show wines that fit the profile.    I love your service but I spend a lot of time looking at offers that I have no interest in. This would allow me to look at wines that I‚Äôm really already ‚Äúpresold‚Äù on.

vivino	GB	APPALLING CUSTOMER SERVICE	14 March 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Firstly this copmpny used to be good to check out wines .However they now have seriously over expanded leading to an extremely poor customer service .In the UK it appears thereis just one girl dealing with all complaints . She said she was overworked as the reason it so long to get back to me, when I had a wrong order delivered. Then the wine supplier also said that he had complained many times to Vivino about the way they advertise half bottles, not making it clear at all they are half and not full bottles when ordered. They refused to change their website and the ensuing problems that occur. There is NO apology and getting a refund takes ages as Vivino controls the money after taking their percentage on top! In fact all they seem to do is pass you onto a supplier and charge everyone for the service. This obviously increases the price of wine for everyone.

vivino	US	Order #X3SJKS0O	10 March 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	"Placed an order with Vivino for Chianti Classico Clemente VII Riserva 2015 on 2/18/21. The wine was being fullfilled by Universal Package Store. Received an email from Vivino that wine had shipped.  Contacted Vivino to get a tracking number but was unsuccessful. Finally received a tracking number for delivery by Lone Star Overnight.  Tracking showed  ""shipping label received"".  Contacted Lone Star and they told me that they never had taken possession. Tried contacting Universal Package Store on a number of occasions was promised to be contacted with updated info but never was.  All I wanted was to get a delivery date because I would need to be available to sign for the wine.  Never received any more info on shipment from anyone.  Finally one day I happened to check the Lone Star Overnight tracking number and learned that the delivery was scheduled for that same day!  Luckily I was able to arrange to be available to sign for the shipment that day.  No advance notice. The delivery of the wine was received on 3/3/21, 13 days after the order was placed!  This is the first time I have ordered wine with Vivino and I must say I am really reluctant to place another order and go through this kind of experience again.  I must tell you, I order wine with many other companies and have never had this kind of difficulty and spent so much of my time trying to obtain info about my wine shipment.  I regret this entire experience and sadly will probably not reorder with Vivino again."

vivino	US	Conundrum Red Wine	05 March 2021	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	Bought a case of 2018 Conundrum red wine.  A couple of the bottles did not taste good, and overall, the wine was not as smooth as bottles bought locally. My wife and I thought we were nuts, but we compared several bottles of the same year and we could definitely tell a difference. This was our first experience with Vivino and we are hesitant to order any more wine.  The price was very good and I would like to think that this was just an isolated case.
vivino	US	Refund received	05 March 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Vivino resolved my missing order issue efficiently. I‚Äôm disappointed I now feel reluctant to order because I don‚Äôt think the couriers they use are reliable. But perhaps I‚Äôll give it one more go and hope for the the best.

vivino	NL	Good, well priced selection. Terrible, terrible logistics.	01 March 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	With a heavy heart I leave this review, after having been a satisfied customer since November of 2020.Four deliveries in a row have gone wrong.. and I don‚Äôt understand what deal they may have with PostNL, but it is ridiculous that we 1) can‚Äôt opt for a time of delivery 2) the parcel is only offered once, and then it‚Äôs up to the customer to pick it up themselves... 3) the parcel(s) are then delivered to a pick up point, far away from you.I mean common.. you can‚Äôt expect customers to figure out transport for 1,2,4,6 etc cases of wine themselves, especially in the Netherlands where not everyone has a car.Best part: the pick up point is not reachable by car.Sadly, vivino, you might loose a customer. I was so happy to have finally found a reliable, fast, good priced wine merchant, to only be disappointed within 2 weeks four(!) times.Please change logistical partner in Netherlands. As I have no car, no means in picking up the wine, I will likely block the payment on my credit card and then you can figure out yourselves how to get your wine back.. all I want is the wine to be delivered as expected, not having to move a finger myself. If I wanted to lug around wine myself I could go to a wine store.Sad sad day. Like truly. Hope this feedback in taken onboard as I actually don‚Äôt want to stop using you.

Another buyer of mine tells me that this wine is NOT available in the US so I call Vivino directly.  They promise me that it will be shipped to me in 3-5 days.  Then 2 days later, they cancel the order with NO EXPLANATION.  Terrible customer service, blatant lying & no accountability.  Don't waste your time with Vivino; you get what you pay for.  Discount = no service, no caring, no wine.

vivino	US	One week wait for FROZEN wine!	13 February 2021	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	It took over a week for my order to arrive.  When I did get my order of expensive red wine delivered, the bottles had ice on the outside of them and the wine was almost frozen.  Vivino should put a warning on the shipping container stating that the contents can not be exposed to extreme cold or heat.  Fedex stored my wine in an unheated area over the weekend (temps were -9) and when finally delivered it was so cold you couldn't handle the bottles.  I am very concerned that my expensive red wine is ruined!! Even the wrappers over the corks are distorted from the cold. Don't think I will order wine from Vivino again!!

They clearly had the address.  They arbitrarily send to one of my businesses in a state where I won't be at for a month.  As you all know you can't let can sit in a hot warehouse for a month.  I emailed customer service several times and asked why they didn't ask me. Bottom line they could care less, said it was fulfilled and wouldn't pick it up and give me my money back. A bunch of crooks as far as I am concerned and would never buy from them again.  And I was a good customer at one time

I opened one bottle and it was very good, so the product lived up to expectations.  It was a real hastle to deal with the problem of the broken bottle.  The real aggravation came when the bottom of the bottle separated from the upper portion and the remaining wine in the bottle spilled all over my counter top, down the cabinets and onto the floor.  Having to clean up that mess didn't make me very happy.

vivino	AU	Terrible experience so far	20 January 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I ordered 6 bottles of wine to be delivered from the Mornington Peninsula to the Bellarine Peninsula all within the same state of Victoria. 8 days after payment the order has still not even been shipped, customer service replies are extremely vague and I will not use this provider again. Hopefully the wine turns up this year!

vivino	US	I made my first purchase in Vivino‚Ä¶	19 January 2021	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	I made my first purchase in Vivino because I was looking for a special wine that I only found in this platform. Great price and selection, but shipping was not smooth. I had to call Vivino to get updates because the shipment was somehow delayed in the sellers site. After my call everything went smooth and I received the wines shortly after.

We would have let you keep it (yeah right) and then they said we have a 20% off ......which when I looked was actually 10%.   DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!   Unless you don‚Äôt mind being screwed!

I find it so weird they never reply - just goes ignored.  Also, one purchase came within two days and other purchases took a couple of weeks but you never knew how long it would take.  Too many online options to settle for no service in my opinion.

vivino	US	Unreliable. Stay away!!!!	15 January 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	"Placed an order on Jan 7th. Get an email claiming ""order has shipped"", and I'll get an update with tracking info soon. After 5 days of nothing, I contact Vivino which then claims they need to contact their fulfillment partner. A few days later I get another email saying my order has now shipped (wait... hadn't they claimed it had already shipped?), and a tracking number would be updated soon. A day later I get a ""tracking number"", which incidentally just takes you to a pop-up claiming the order is being ""prepared for shipment"". Hello? Seriously... Vivino has already claimed TWICE that it had already been shipped! I give it another day: same pop-up information. I contact Vivino again, asking them to either provide real tracking information within 24 hours, or cancel my order. This time no response. Oddly enough Vivino is in a hurry to charge your card for the order, but in no hurry at all to fulfill it. You'll be able to grow your own grapes and ferment your own wine before you get it from Vivino.To date, they still have nether provided my order, nor returned my money. I'll be taking legal action. It's about principle, not money. I'll gladly spend $10,000 in legal fees to get $1 of satisfaction.UPDATE Jan 15: Just contacted the claimed delivery company (LSO) directly regarding the ""tracking number"". They said Vivino contacted them to get a tracking number on Jan 11, but have done nothing with it since. All appearances indicate Vivino obtained a number simply to placate my request for verification, with no intention of using it. I would highly advise steering clear of this company, as the ""positive"" reviews are likely phony. Read the negative reviews: They share similar stories."

vivino	US	I placed an order for 2 bottles of wine‚Ä¶	13 January 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I placed an order for 2 bottles of wine on 12/17.  Got tracking information right away saying it would be delivered on 12/28.  After over 2 weeks of the wine not shipping i sent a message to customer service.  They advised a day later they will need to look into this.  Then the order finally delivered but way too late to enjoy over the holidays.  Also when i opened up the package there was a note inside that said the one bottle they did not have in inventory so they substituted with another bottle of wine.  This is extremely bizarre that would just subtitute it with another wine.  Second why was i not notified that the wine i ordered was out of stock. I could have picked another wine.  Lastly the wine i ordered was valued at 26.99 and the wine that they substituted it with was valued at 9.99.  Why am i being charged the same amount when i got a lower value wine.  Need less to say this is very frustrating.  I would think there should be some type of compensation for this as i did not get the wine i ordered nor was shipped in a timely manner.
vivino	GB	Disappointing	13 January 2021	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	The image on the Vivino app was the wine I wanted to purchase, the 12 bottles that arrived was from the correct winery but the wine was not the vintage I ordered. Disappointing.

A limited number of bottles were available to encourage possible buyers even more. After the bottles were gone the wine stayed available, but the price was changed to 24.90 euros down from 30 euros. Advertised with a 17% discount. This means my actual discount was 33% and not 50%. Still a fairly good price. But not near 50% as was advertised.

Based on this experience, I recently placed two orders; however found the overall lag time regarding customer response and experience very frustrating . While I received the wines I ordered and they were in very good condition, there were some challenges in communicating with the Vivino team and supplier/fulfillment partner which caused frustration. Once I got Vivino's attention, they worked very hard to rectify the problems encountered. Due to this, likely I will place an order again in the future, and ideally they will have increased their response time which will help overall experience.

This was advertised as a $90.00 bottle of wine with the quality and of the region of Stags Leap wines.  I paid $28.99 per bottle for this wine. This proved to be nothing more the a mediocre wine.  It was a decent wine that I would normally expect to buy in the $18.00 to $20.00 range.  Frankly nothing to write home about.  I will go to my neighborhood liquor store for advice on wine going forward.

vivino	GB	Ordered countless bottles from Vivino‚Ä¶	24 December 2020	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	Ordered countless bottles from Vivino over the past year and never had a single issue. You do have to make sure all the wines you're ordering are from the same supplier and the website doesn't make it simple to do that - but aside from that the prices are fair and delivery is always pretty quick. Fast becoming my go-to wine shop due to their regular sales on higher end wines like Tignanello - which makes them the best price in the UK when they happen. Will no doubt continue to use them. Just wish you could filter by Vivino supplied wines only and remove third parties - to stop ending up with multiple baskets.
vivino	US	Exceptionally rapid service	24 December 2020	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Exceptionally rapid service, the wine ordere filled correctly and I like the fact that they bundle shipping costs into the price. It just seems to make a painful extra cost go down easier!

vivino	US	I bit on this offer because it sounded‚Ä¶	22 December 2020	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	I bit on this offer because it sounded like a wine I would really like and the accolades made it sound highly rated.  I would say that it is a good wine but did not live up to my expectations.  The body was not as full as I had anticipated by the write up.  It is a little more fruit forward than other high rated cabs.  Complexity is medium and the finish has subtle characteristics.  Overall, is it a good value for a $20.00 bottle wine, yes.  I would say that if your expectations are built around what the write up said, you may be disappointed but you would still enjoy the price point.
vivino	US	I never received my wine order	22 December 2020	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	"I never received my wine order.  I received notification that my order had been received which alarmed me since I had not, so I found the tracking number and started the investigation.  I saw that the wine order was still with shipper GLS in Phoenix and that the shipper rescheduled the delivery.  I called Vivino customer service and was asked to give it a few more days because the shipping status changed according to the Vivino agent to ""out for delivery"".  I gave it 3 more days - wine on the truck for 3 or more days is not acceptable to me.  So when it didn't arrive after the 3 days I called Vivino customer service and received a refund.  Aly was understanding and executed to refund without any argument.  Unfortunately I had to spend a couple of hours to sort this out."
vivino	ES	Finding Vivino was a miracle	22 December 2020	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Finding Vivino was a miracle! I was looking forward to gift some Spanish wine for my daughter‚Äôs lovely host family in Texas, but customs made it impossible... I found in Vivino some of my favourite red wines (Emilio  Moro and Cune, from Rioja and Ribera de Duero denomination of origin ) and Rueda denomination white wine, Palacio de Bornos. Buying was really easy, price is not expensive and quick delivery.... I‚Äôll repeat! Thanks Vivino

vivino	DE	Order not received and not acceptable service	22 December 2020	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I didn‚Äôt receive the parcel but DPD changed the order status to ‚Äúdelivered‚Äù and they also recorded a wrong sign that I would have received it.I contacted Vivino and explained everything but the only answer I got from them was like ‚ÄúWe have tracked your order and it was delivered to you. We also have a proof that you have signed.‚ÄùThis was so irresponsible as I have ordered a quite expensive bottle as it was supposed to be a gift.

vivino	US	1st order experience...	18 December 2020	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	1st order experience required about 10 business days.   I had ordered 6 bottles though received 5 (about 7 days), with an apology note from the shipper.  The credit back for the offset posted about 5 days later.     All seemed alright, just a little slower than expected.  I‚Äôll likely give it a try again.
vivino	US	Customer service is terrible	18 December 2020	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	"Customer service is terrible. I placed two orders for Portuguese wine that I wanted. The first order, the more expensive one, arrived about two weeks later. I received an email confirming the second order which was for 21 bottles of wine (the remaining stock) but never received the shipping confirmation. I tried to contact them several times and got no response. I checked back on the website to find the same 21 bottles I ordered now advertised at a higher price. I am still waiting on the 21 bottles of wine I pad for 3 months after the fact and am having to go to my credit card company to get a refund. I eventually got an email from Vivino saying ""We‚Äôve been a bit backed up, but doing our best to catch up! We appreciate your patience."" and ""it seems like the merchant did not have enough stock "". I pointed out to them that this was false information and that they were misinformed or intentionally trying to mislead me."

vivino	US	Major Failure	17 December 2020	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	"After a horrible customer service situation in August, I decided to give Vivino a second chance to deliver a Christmas Gift of  6 bottles of wine. I placed the order Dec. 4th, wanting it delivered way before Christmas. I got an email Dec 6th that there was a slight delay in shipping. I got an email Dec 7th that the order had been shipped. On Dec 9th, I clicked on the link provided in that email to check the status. It took me to a page saying that the order had not been shipped yet. Same message December 10th, so I clicked on the ""contact us"" link, which opened a pre-addressed email to Vivino. I gave all the details requested and hit ""send"". A few minutes later, I got a return email telling me that the email address I used (the one Vivino automatically put in) was not in use, and it listed a variety of other email addresses. So, I picked the ""us"" one, and resent the email. I sent another email on Dec 13th, having no response by that day. I sent another follow up Dec 15th. Still no response. I tried to cancel the order but, like the email I got, there was a message that it had been shipped (which the web site says is not true.) I tried to use the ""chat"" feature on Vivino's web site but I keep being told there is no one to help."

vivino	US	Excellent wine and service from Vivino	16 December 2020	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I recently ordered a case of the 2017 BR Cohn cabernet, tried 1 bottle and immediately ordered another case.  The second case even arrived a day early, Have ordered 4 different cases and each one arrived on time, I always arrange with FedEx to pick up the wine at  their distribution center so it doesn't sit in the truck all day, especially in the summertime. The BR Cohn is very tasty already, can't wait until it cellars for a couple of years.  A good friend belongs to the BR Cohn wine club and he paid more for the wine than I did through Vivino.  Thanks for a great bargain.

Order was cancelled by You and returned to sender. I attempted to reorder 6 bottles but the cost went up to $59.00 per bottle plus tax and shipping. I received a text from you and I stated I was not willing to reorder (even with a 10% discount) at the higher price. I would only purchase at the price I agreed initially.  Since I have not heard anything from you I gave up. Unless this is corrected I will never use you again and will never recommend you. I can't even call and discuss this with anyone since there is no number listed.

vivino	US	Delivery Nightmare	15 December 2020	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Ordered 17 bottles of wine for ~$800.00.  I have spent thousands over the years.  Delivery here in Texas can be bothersome as you must sign for the delivery or have it delivered at a FEDEX drop-off point.  i chose the latter.  When I arrived to pick up, there was only  1 x box with 8 wines... of course the cheapest 8 of the 17 bottles.  Vivino and FEDEX sent me a notification saying delivery was complete.  Now after 5 days, Im still trying to get resolution.  I sent them the fedex deliver form --  1 box at 5 lbs.  Nobody seems to care from either the shipper (Yiannis), FEDEX or, most importantly Vivino.  A lot of unfilled promises in this ordeal.  I guess Ill just keep writing these critiques until something is actioned.

Next delivery date was then going to be 9th December but I was out all day as I didn't know this until mid-morning on the same day and when, after contacting Vivino customer services, I checked the delivery details (to change my delivery instructions to leave in my porch) DHL's website said my wine was due for delivery 1st January! I just hope after all this the wine is nice as the delivery service hasn't left me wanting to buy any more wine from Vivino.

vivino	US	Some amazing discounts	08 December 2020	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I've had the Vivino app on my iPhone for years and use it to rate the occasional wine.  But, when I received an email with an extraordinary price on one of my favorite winery cabs (Beringer) I simply couldn't believe it.  So, I did some research and the price was right.  What Beringer wanted $70 a bottle for, and Total Wine wanted $59.99 for, Vivino had for the extrodinary price of $32.99.  The wine -- a 2015 Beringer Distinction Series Cabernet Sauvignon -- is just perfect at full retail, but at a discount it's terrific.

The messaging regarding the order was strange as I received an email from Vivino saying the order was cancelled and that I was to contact the shipping company to figure out what was wrong? I was provided a tracking number as well. Turns out the issue was a label issue (according to FEDEX) and the shipment was just delayed. First iy was supposed to arrive Sunday evening, then Monday evening and ultimately arrived Tuesday afternoon. Overall not a big issue, but it seems that there is some logistics coordination that needs an update :)

vivino	US	Poor service of the partner merchant	27 November 2020	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	"I placed the order via Vivino at the partner merchant (Yiannis Wine Shop). The delay between the order placement and the shipment was 12 days (order placed Nov. 8th, shipped - Nov. 20th. Of those, first five days it took to send me the correct tracking number. Next, although order status was ""Shipped"" when checked at Vivino.com, the status checked at FedEx was ""Pending"". Vivino's representative told me that the status was set by the partner merchant ""when they generated the shipping label for your order"". Which is misleading enough.)Unfortunately, all those delays and incorrect information provided (in addition to the necessity to replace one of the items 11 days after the order was placed) left overall poor impression from either Yiannis Wine Shop (""partner merchant""), vivino.com, or both. It is especially sad to leave this unpleasant review because my prior experience ordering via vivino.com (with other partner merchants though) was good."

So I emailed the uk orders email address manually from their website.   Three days later no reply.   This morning I tried a web chat..

vivino	US	Wrong wine delivered	19 November 2020	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Oct 2020. We ordered 12 bottles of Anselmi San Vincenzo 2016 from Vivino, fulfilled by Flask Fine Wine and Spirits. They actually shipped 6 bottles of a Malbec. After having to Google Vivinos return policy, as it's not on the app OR in the FAQ page, we had to make multiple attempts to get a response over 3 weeks we ended up having to dispute the Amex charge in order to get a refund. 4 weeks after we received the Malbec, they have just provided a return label for the Malbec. We won't be ordering from Vivino again.
vivino	US	Excellent wine at great price. Not a 96 rating, though	18 November 2020	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	Wine is excellent and at a great price point. The reason I don‚Äôt rate higher is because Vivino advertised this as a 96 rating from Wine Spectator. After I received the wine I searched the rating and see it only gets 91 rating.  I thought I was getting a very special wine at a low price point. I can purchase many other wines at the same price point with a 91 rating. I am disappointed that I feel this was not correctly promoted by Vivino. I would be very happy to change my review if Vivino responds and either shows me that I am wrong or removes the rating from their website and provides some compensation for the error.

The guy blame the logistic partner . But I made the order to vivino so i do not care who is the logistic partner. Every day the customer service tells that is for next day... it never arrives. I suggested to send it again. They cannot... I asked for refund ... the customer service said that they will refund once they get the wine back from the logistic. Now this is ridicoulous.I have already place order to the two main competitors in Italy that delivered in 36 hours. With Vivino after 3 weeks I still have to chase them everyday.... Terrible

vivino	US	One Cart please	17 November 2020	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	The issue I have most with Vivino is all wine purchased does not go to the same cart.  The wine we purchased is delicious at a good price.  Using the coupon was a challenge trying to get all wines in one cart.  The wines are top notch, so we will keep looking and hoping to fill a cart before the deal disappears.
vivino	US	Never ordering from Vivino again	17 November 2020	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	While previous orders via Vivino have been basically without issue, my latest order has me questioning why I would ever order from Vivino again. One thing I cannot complain about was their customer service because THERE WASN'T ANY!  On Oct. 23, we ordered a nice Sean Minor wine through Vivino and our credit card was promptly charged, but that was all that happened. A week into November and we had heard nothing - no order confirmation, no shipping date, no tracking number, nothing. Two emails to Vivino went unanswered. And repeated attempts to use Vivino's live online chat brought only more futility; every time I'd get to the front of the cue, the chat connection would mysteriously disappear. Finally, we contacted our credit card company and contested the charges, which were taken off our card. A couple of days later, we get a note from Vivino that our wine would be delivered the following day. We didn't even know it had been shipped! Bottom line: We got the wine we ordered and the charge to our credit card was restored. But it was far more trouble thsn it was worth. And through it all, we have yet to talk to any Vivino customer service person. I'm wondering if Vivino even has such.
vivino	US	This was  my first time to order wine‚Ä¶	17 November 2020	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	This was  my first time to order wine recommended by Vivino.  I have been a very loyal user of Vivino; it really helped me try new wine at stores.  But I really don't like the wine I ordered and I don't even want to open a second bottle.  I thought I knew the right descriptions of the kind of cab's I prefer.  But I think I acted too hastily and trusted Vivino not to steer me so wrong to the point that I don't even want to even drink a $100 worth of wine.  I will ask my family to try it to get more opinions.

My wine was not delivered to me, it ended up on a dock in Napa, which is quite a distance from Pennsylvania.  I have spent over 4 hours trying to contact someone to address the situation.  I have sent numerous emails, and tried to use the live chat feature to reach someone. The live chat was such a frustrating experience, I just gave up and sent emails. It has now been almost a week and still no response.  I am calling my credit card company and refusing to pay the charge.  As a frequent purchaser of wine on line, I can speak with a good deal of experience that no other business treats its customers this way.

vivino	US	Good shopping experience, great customer service	12 November 2020	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	There were problems with my order, but I'm giving Vivino five stars which they deserve with how they handled the problems.  First, for some reason I never got the shipping notification e-mail until after I had taken the delivery and gotten the delivery notification e-mail. It happens :).  The actual problem was that instead of the 8 bottles of one type of wine that was in the order, the wine shop selling through Vivino had sent 7 bottles of another type from the same winery, but not really interchangeable. (It was a large order, and everything else was fine with it.)  Upon contacting Vivino customer support with phone, they immediately sent a follow-up e-mail and directed me to respond to that with a photo of the bottles I received by mistake. Once I did that, within a few hours I had a refund.  Since that was my first ever order with the site, this meant they also have a repeat customer.

vivino	US	Excellent Convenience & Cost	04 November 2020	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I extensively sought out a specific label and vintage year of a wine that is hard to find in stores locally, so was incredibly delighted to find Vivino had it in stock and would deliver to my state (Wisconsin). The ordering process was very easy online which saved the big hassle of having to travel out of my immediate area to the one store who carries it in another town. Beyond the convenience of purchasing through Vivino, I also found the cost of buying multiple bottles of the wine to be even a little less with the case discount. It urged me to start my Christmas shopping for friends & neighbors early and ordered 3 cases! The shipment was easily tracked and arrived timely in very substantial protective packaging inside the strong boxes, so all bottles arrived in perfect condition. Due to alcohol shipment restrictions, it did require someone over age 21 to be present to sign for the cases of wine. Vivino will definitely be my preferred method of buying wine, it‚Äôs so quick & easy!

vivino	US	CLOWN SHOW ‚Äì JOKE‚ÄôS ON YOU!	01 November 2020	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Understand that Vivino is not a brick and mortar wine merchant. They don‚Äôt inventory, ship or invoice wine. They have a great app that features user content and brings together customers with nationwide independent wine merchants. Vivino is paid an override by the wine merchant on sales made through their app. Follow the money and you‚Äôll discover why Vivino has zero customer service and no real power or interest to fix misdeeds on the part of their wine sellers. Vivino is paid by wine merchants ‚Äì not you. When you buy wine through Vivino you are dealing with independent wine merchants some of whom are unreliable and/or unscrupulous. Whether you have a good experience or a nightmare depends entirely on the integrity of the wine merchant you purchased from. In the words of Dirty Harry, ‚Äúdo you feel lucky?‚Äù My tale of woe could as easily be you.I bought half a case of wine from Vivino (or so I thought at the time). Peeling the foil top off the first bottle showed signs of leakage around the cork and the foil was wet with wine. The stewed prune taste of the wine confirmed the wine had been ‚Äòcooked‚Äô.  This was in November so the weather had been cool. The wine was cooked by improper storage before it was shipped to me. I opened another bottle with the same result. I reached out to Vivino through their customer service e-mail. A week later I get a response questioning why I was making a claim four days after I received the shipment (implying that the wine was cooked on my watch). After my response, Vivino came back with their ‚Äòresolution‚Äô to offer a ten percent discount on future purchases in exchange for the stewed prune juice I bought through Vivino. Replace it or refund it, I advised but Vivino said that‚Äôs up to the wine merchant; it‚Äôs not up to Vivino. This game of telephone went on for two months with Vivino deferring to the wine merchant who was taking no responsibility. With it clear the wine merchant had no intention to cooperate, I filled a dispute with my credit card company and three weeks later I finally received a call tag for return shipment. The wine merchant and Vivino claimed the wine had not been returned. Fortunately I keep complete records and sent American Express copies of all communications and the signed proof of delivery for the return wine shipment. Three months after starting this saga I had complete refund FROM AMERICAN EXPRESS not from Vivino or their wine merchant who both made every effort to obfuscate and deny. Never again!Tell me why anybody would want to buy wine from a middleman like Vivino who‚Äôs only allegiance is to the folks who pay them ‚Äì the wine merchants.
vivino	US	On-line Form	01 November 2020	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	Ive already written this review to you about a week ago, but I'll send it again.  The online form requesting info does not separate the buyer name/address from the recipient name/address.  I bought the wine for my dtr and son in law.  So they rcvd the box that had my name with their address, etc.  I think it could be done a little better than that.  Otherwise, the wine was delivered just fine.

vivino	AU	Most enjoyable	31 October 2020	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I'm not an experienced Grand Cru drinker to offer serious drinkers sophisticated feedback however this was very enjoyable!Its smooth and lingers on the palet. Initially I said it had a creamy flavour however my husband pointed out green apples like a Granny Smith.
vivino	US	the good and the bad *updated*	31 October 2020	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	the good - my order was filled after a week the bad - I'd reached out to Vivino twice to get a status on my order without any response.  For 6 days I had no idea of order status.Update 11/7: Vivino reached out to me to apologize and explained that there was a recent shift to a new phone system.  They were very accommodating and as such I've updated my rating experience to reflect that.  Thank you Vivino for following up with me.

vivino	US	Lousy Customer Service	28 October 2020	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Immediately after placing my order, I responded to the email and advised Vivino that I had ordered the incorrect year for the wine.  I received no response.  Two days later, prior to the shipping of the wine, I again sent an email.  No response.  I sent a third and last email.  No response.   Needless to say that I received the wine with the wrong year.  Very disappointed with the lack of response from Customer Service.   Thia was my first order and probably the last.

I took advantage of special pricing on a promising Pinot Noir and ordered 6 bottles.  The wine arrived in short order, very professionally packaged.

vivino	US	Great service, great product ... recommended	23 October 2020	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	We like the Culprit but could not find it in our area. So I went online and discovered these Vivino guys. They had the product so I ordered a dozen. I was a bit worried about buying wine on lie. My box arrived well packaged, four layers of 3 bottles protected each by formed cardboard and in absolute perfect shape (no spill, broken, ...). Additionally their price was the same as our large wine and spirits stores. Bottom line: good price, good delivery service, great selection. Go for it.

vivino	US	Peace of wine	23 October 2020	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I have been using Vivino for about 5 years, but it has been only during the last two years that I have discovered how useful it is to organize my wines, read about the wines I like, read some thought provoking reviews and, lately, the great taste profile keeps me abreast of what I would like to try next. It also gives me a chance to rate and post reviews of my experience with the wines I taste.
vivino	US	Poor Service	23 October 2020	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Ordered 3 bottles of wine to be delivered to a friend a month ago.  Never got a confirmation or delivery.  When I followed up after 2 weeks, I was told that the supplier didn't have enough in inventory (but they still managed to charge my account for the full amount), and I was given the option to send the two they had.  I said this was ok, and have not heard a word since.  Now they are ghosting me.  I would not use this app.

Checked on my order and was told that the vendor would ship and send a tracking notice by march 30th.  Not thrilled but waited and today April 1 I contacted them to find out that it would not ship until April 15th.  You had my money you should have been in contact with me instead of me chasing you!!

I said ‚Äúsure.‚Äù 4. A case of 2018 Chardonnay was delivered.  5.  I called to have it fixed.  6.  One week later, I have still not received a notification that my Cabernet has been shipped.  Sorry folks, but if you are asking for a review one week after my purchase, that‚Äôs what you get - honesty.
vivino	US	Great price and fast delivery	14 October 2020	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Great price and fast delivery. Will definitely buy from the site again!
vivino	US	It started with getting a case & 1/2 of‚Ä¶	14 October 2020	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	It started with getting a case & 1/2 of wine which came to Florida and 2 bottles were cooked.  There was no ice packs in the boxes. Instead of just replacing the 2 cooked bottles they gave me a credit on my next order. In the meantime they sent me an email for an additional 10% off a case. When I tried to use it on a new case they said because I had a previous credit for the bad wine I could not do both. I ordered the new case and when the bill came the price for 3 of the bottles was about 5.00 more on each bottle. The  advertised price of  the bottles on Vivino's Website was the lower price when I put in 3 bottles and the same price was listed for 3 bottles as they had for 12.  However they billed me the higher price.  I sent them a screenshot of their website and they still would not adjust the price to what the website showed for 3 bottles.  Instead they said the customer must  look at a different billing link.  This is purely deceptive advertising.  BEWARE  I could have secured the same wine locally for the price they are now charging me and the only reason I ordered it from them was based on their advertised price.
vivino	US	Like the app	14 October 2020	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I really like their app for keeping track of the wines we've tried, seeing how others have rated different bottles, and for checking prices at the store to see if we are getting a good deal.
vivino	US	Great Service, Great App	14 October 2020	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Super easy, efficient, a case of wine I can no longer get from my local store.  Vivino is a great app for tracking my wine tastes, good and bad, great suggestions.
vivino	US	Longtime customer	14 October 2020	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	"Longtime customer. Have bought several thousand $$ of wine from them over time. Couple of days ago I bought 6 bottles of Stag's leap ""The Leap"" 2016 Cab.At about $85/bottle  - Soon as I hit ""BUY"" I noticed there was a promo code which would have given me an extra 10% off - this code was placed in a location - as if wanted they you to miss it. There was no going back. Since then I have contacted them 4 times via email ‚Äì and have not heard from them even once - of course there is NO NUMBER that I can find easily to ask them to either cancel my order or give me the 10% off - THE CUSTOMER SERVICE DEPARTMENT IS SLEEPING AT THE WHEEL AND LOCATED ON MARS! i AM CANCELLING MY ACCOUNT AND NOT BUYING FROM THEM AGAIN AS THE AGGRAVATION OF NOT BEING ABLE TO TALK TO A CUSTOMER SERVICE PERSON TO FIX ISSUES IS JUST plain UNPROFESSIONAL."

I have used the My Cellar app for a few years now, it allows me to keep track of my collection and is extreamly easy to use.  Love the Vivino app over all, it allows me to look up a bottle of something I found or dont know about, and gives me a good overall opinion of the wine.  I have bought and not bought many bottles based on the app.  I recommend Vivino to any wine lover...

vivino	US	Poor packaging and poor customer service	09 October 2020	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	Ordered a case of wine. Bottles were poorly packaged resulting in damage to multiple bottles. Have tried for a week to get this issue resolved with giving customer service and have yet to have a resolution. Also, the merchant that shipped the wine must have poor storage conditions or the wines are counterfeit because they taste nothing like the same wine from the winery. I will not be using this service again due to the poor customer service and quality issues.

I have ordered many cases of fine wines from Vivino and usually the orders are fine.  But when they make a mistake, good luck getting a response.  They recently shipped me a case of Caymus cab but sent 375ml bottles instead of the 750ml I ordered.  I have made 3 requests via their ""Customer Service"" portal and not a single response in a week.  There is no phone number to call and there is nothing you can do except hope they someday respond.  Good luck with that.  I will never buy wine from them again and neither should you."

My order was fulfilled without problem.  We ordered 6 bottles of Quilt Cabernet by the owners of Caymus.  The first bottle was outstanding....then we opened the second...pure vinegar...same for the third and fourth!  Hogs hoes this happen. Have not heard back from them and in fairness it has only been a day since I sent them email...so my next rating will be based on their response....this site leads me to believe it could go either way.  Anyone have a phone # for Vivino?. I found a couple of addresses (email) and sent details to them....I‚Äôll update this as resolved but being as angry as I am if they don‚Äôt accept accountability....I will be relentless in repeating this experience throughout the Internet.  I have a couple of friends in the Industry who have offered help.  On the other hand if they step up I will repost with that experience and a higher review.  Time will tell.

vivino	US	Vivino did a very good job yet Im not 100% Satisfied	11 September 2020	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	Vivino did a very good job yet Im not giving 5 stars as the prosecco arrived to me in Florida, extremely warm to the touch. That shouldnt be as the shipper should have taken care to either ship it express, include it in the price per bottle or wrapped it in a manner where the extreme transport heat would not have affected the bottles, so.
vivino	US	Vivino helped me get high priced wine for a low cost!	11 September 2020	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Placed an order through Vivino for the first time, best experience ever. Was able to get what I was looking for at a great price. Was shipped right to my door in 3 days. Yannais wine shop was the shipper and they did an awesome job with packing and sending my wine. I was even able to get 5% off the already low price with a coupon from Vivino. I have zero complaints and recommend everyone to use Vivino and Yannais wine shop!!

Recently ordered for the first time and the shipper shipped via FedEx.  They took several days to deliver to FedEX and then FedEx initially lost the package and then found it and barely delivered in time for the event we ordered for.  If Vivino could have more accurate shipping and faster shipping then it would be 5 stars for sure!

vivino	GB	Worst on line purchasing experience‚Ä¶	04 September 2020	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Worst on line purchasing experience ever!!!!Ordered 12 Bottles of wine, 4 Barolo, 4 Whispering Angel and 2  Rioja all showing in stock.Order accepted, follow up confirmation email did not take place - when I contacted them I was informed that Barolo was out of stock and would take a week before they could send the order. Any discussion about it showing in stock when I ordered was quickly swept away as meaningless.So I waited a week and then received a communication to say that they could not deliver the full order as one bottle was out of stock - this time a Whispering Angel - this was now 8 days after original order acceptance. I contacted the supplier direct who informed me that it was an issue because Vivino did not update their stock records on a regular basis. He was full of apologies for an issue that was not his, we resolved and the order was dispatched the following day.No correspondence from Vivino, no control over stocks, no apologies - no future orders.Dealt with Virgin Wines  for 10 years and never had an issue.

vivino	US	Vivino doesn't care about the customer.	02 September 2020	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I would have given them zero stars if allowed.  They don't support the customer when there is an issue.  I've purchased many times from Vivino without an issue.  But you get to know a company when an issue happens.  FedEx screwed up the delivery and my wine was ruined.  At $100 per bottle (x6) I expect more.  When I contacted Vivino they blew me off, and didn't take ownership of the problem.  That's the last time I will purchase wine from them.

vivino	US	Don't bother. This company is horrible.	01 September 2020	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I would like to start out by saying that I am a person who has never written a post like this. I'm not a person that complains about everything. I understand how hard these companies work and am a small business owner myself. Suffice to say, this company's service was so horrible that I need to let other people know about this. Vivino had terrible customer service. I did not receive my order of wine for 3 weeks. My order was placed on August 14th and when I made the purchase, the website informed me that they would arrive the following Tuesday, August 18th.  So the days begin to pass.... and I received no notification of my order being shipped. When I reached out to customer service around the date that my order was supposed to arrive, I was told that they would check in with the company who the wine is shipped through. After a couple of days, I followed up because I had not heard anything. I was informed that they had not heard back from the company but that my order would be shipped today. The following Monday, August 23rd, I finally heard back from the customer service rep, who was able to provide shipping information. Clearly, my order had not been shipped the past Friday. Finally, my order arrived later that week. ...And then, my order arrived incomplete! There were two bottles completely missing. Navigating how to contact Vivino about this was rather convoluted. The email I received confirming the reception of my order said to reply directly to the email with any questions or concerns, but when I did this, it seemed to be a dead address and was returned to me!  After finally getting into contact with someone through an email address I found on the website, I just simply asked for a refund because I didn't want to deal with it anymore. The customer service rep insisted that she would reach out and try to get the wine shipped. A whole week later, after sending two additional emails asking about any updates and just simply asking for my money back for those two bottles, I FINALLY received a refund for the missing bottles.Needless to say... If you don't have 3 weeks of free time to continuously follow up with sales reps who are clearly understaffed and a company that does not have it together... don't bother!

vivino	US	Failed temperature controlled shipments - repeated	13 August 2020	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	"I've been ordering from Vivino off and on for a few years.  I'm located in the Northeast and summer temp's are in the 80's.  My last 4 orders (summer time) were supposed to be shipped temperature controlled with ice pack in a styrofoam container.  Ordered on Tuesday and shipment arrived here on Thursday (2 days).  They put it in a styrofoam container BUT the ""nordic ice pack"" they put in was completely warm and the bottles were warm.  There's no way in 2 days a frozen ice pack within a styrofoam container should've been warm (and there was no condensation indicating the ice pack had ever been chilled).  I've had this across multiple Vivino merchants who are supposed to be putting ice packs in.  I believe the merchants are putting in unchilled ice packs....  I've relayed this to their (non-existent and VERY SLOW to respond) customer support.  Won't be ordering anymore with this service."
vivino	US	Deceptive Advertising of Vintage (bait and switch)	13 August 2020	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	"I ordered the vintage 2013 of the Keenan Cabernet Sauvignon, which was a very specific year. It was for my anniversary, so it had meaning. The product page stated 2013 for a price of $53.99 per bottle which is a very good deal. Unfortunately, Vivino is deceptively duping customers by switching the vintage in their shopping cart without notice. (they updated the product page - see below) Even though they acknowledged that they do not have the 2013 vintage and I have notified them that they are automatically switching the vintage in the shopping cart, they still have not corrected the issue on their site. You can see this behavior by visiting the link provided and adding the bottle to your shopping cart. As I see now, they have added small text stating the 2015 vintage, which is still deceptive as you can see the vintage in the title of the product is about 50 times larger. Note, that the small vintage text was not there when I made the purchase making all that more deceptive. I contacted them and they are ""acting nice"", but have been playing a respond and delay game on me. They just sent an email stating that it has to be within 14 days, yet I contacted them with this issue on the very day that I received the incorrect vintage."

We have been delighted with the purchase and I am looking for some more great deals.

vivino	US	Cheap Cab is not drinkable	31 July 2020	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I thought the vineyard would take pride in their name so the less expensive Cab would likely be less complex and/or interesting - but still good.

vivino	US	A Few Glitches but pleased in the end	30 June 2020	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I was able to find and order my favorite wine through Vivino. Concerns were that my card was charged immediately, before the wine shipped. Another concern was that Vivino sent an email that said the wine had shipped and that I would be receiving it the next day, when in fact, only a shipping label was created and the wine wasn‚Äôt shipped until over a week later. Other than that, my wine came, as ordered, it was packaged well, and Vivino customer service did get back to me in a timely manner when I had concerns. Cheers! Edited to add that every order placed subsequent to the above was a problem. Fed ex left cases of wine sitting in their facility long after delivery was promised. Bottles were broken and the shipment returned to sender and I couldn‚Äôt get any response from Vivino customer service when I had problems. Needless to say, I no longer use Vivino to order wine.

vivino	US	Very disappointed	25 June 2020	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I am so blatantly disappointed with Vivino that i can't see straight.  I ordered $100 bottles of wine for a great price of $30 only to be lied to by UPS who didn't deliver it and sent it back to CA.  I made 4 attempts to have it delivered to no avail.  Vivino wouldn't/couldn't send me my wine (don't understand that) but i did get a stinking 10% code that expires in 4 days.  SHAME ON YOU!

vivino	CH	A personal experience	25 June 2020	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	"I am a certified sommelier with several years of experience in the wine industry. I haven't bought any wine on this website and this review refers to the Vivino concept as a whole and the way wines are rated on their website. I think it can help people from making costly mistakes.To start off, much like Tripadvisor granted to everyone who wished it the possibility of becoming a food columnist, so did Vivino give everybody the chance to pose as a wine critic. The vast majority of tastings on this website are unprofessional, unreliable and amusing at best. Users write inaccurate reports, tossing terms such as sweet and tannic out of context, and describing aromas and flavors that most of the wines don't possess. A lot of times they contradict themselves, calling a wine fruity only to proceed and say that the same wine is ""mature"" and ""ready to drink now"". Perhaps they don't know that certain wines cannot be fruity AND mature at the same time,  because generally speaking, a mature wine is a wine where the fruity aromas have given way to secondary flavors.Amateurs aside, the main problem resides in how reviews are listed. Lower ratings are consistently hidden, while good reviews are put in the spotlight. This puts a question on how genuine certain reviews are. I suspect (though I have no proof) that if a user wants to gain visibility, he just has to review a few dozens wines randomly and give them top marks. So what is the point of Vivino? Provide an accurate, competent exchange of tasting information or have their wines simply rated high so that they will sell better? To conclude, I will just tell this brief anecdote: I came upon a user who holds great visibility and top ratings on the website. I discovered that some of his reviews were copied straight from another website (a Swiss merchandise retailer) and only slightly edited, to make them look different. I highly doubt that he authored the original reviews, as those were the reviews written by the Swiss retail company itself. I published a comment to point it out, but the comment never got published. Other reviews I wrote about wines that were, in my opinion, over priced, were published only after weeks and sit hidden at the bottom, where nobody can read them.So this s my experience, folks. There are issues. Should you be undecided about purchasing a specific wine, follow my advice and do no take that star-rating too seriously. Do your research elsewhere, the internet is wide and large."
vivino	US	Very good customer service	25 June 2020	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	
vivino	AU	Terrible communication	25 June 2020	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I found the communication with Vivino truly dreadful.  I emailed to ask for my order to be delivered during this week as I was to be away from home during the previous week when the order had been made and would otherwise have been delivered.  After a series of confusing and wrong emails from Vienne at Vivino, I thought he/she understood the request but no, the wine was delivered while I was away.  So the communication came to nothing.  That delivery of wine could easily have been stolen from the front of my house. If this is the standard set by Vivino, under the heading of customer service, than it appears that this is a business that can't be trusted.
vivino	US	Pretty great	25 June 2020	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	Really like the wine warm over chilled. Pineapple and other fruit flavors. Very dry but good!

Even if I were expecting a drier wine, I could‚Äôve never anticipated the blatant lack of taste it had. I mean did he even taste it himself?You know what‚Äî he drinks Budlight so he probably did and loved it.All is well! I‚Äôll have to figure out where to submit my product review.

Easy online ordering via their informative app and the wine was delivered by lunchtime the very next day. I have worked in the wine trade for over twenty years and have bought from most merchants, Vivino move into the top ranked among them.
vivino	US	Good Result from Shipping Exception	23 June 2020	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	"We recently ordered a case of wine from Vivino.   The wine was being shipped across country.  On the day that it was supposed to arrive we received a message from UPS that it was being returned to the sender due to a ""leakage problem"".  Vivino offered us a credit but we really wanted the wine and requested instead that the seller re-ship the order.  Catch 22 was that the seller could not reship the order until they received the defective case back.Long story short - the case got lost in the UPS system.  To my knowledge the seller never got the case back.  Tim, from Vivino Customer Service, organized the credit and arranged for the product to reship from two different vendors.  Tim really worked hard on this one.  We really appreciate his efforts."

My order arrived in two days.  I have tried only one of the three different types of wine I ordered but it was excellent, well worth the price.  It is very nice that shipping is included for orders over $99.  Prices appeared to include taxes as well.  It is nice to purchase something without hidden, unexpected fees.
vivino	US	Good overall wine buying experience	18 June 2020	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	Good overall wine buying experience. The wines I did sample were as good or better than described. The only negative was that the wine sat with UPS for two days so it was not in a temperature controlled truck for that time. Additionally, Vivino, knowing of the delay, indicated that an ice pack would be added to the package but when it was opened, there was no ice pack to be found.

However with the last order I was missing one box of wine, although it said it was delivered (I was not at the door receiving the delivery). So almost right after I called the number, but I got a tape saying business hours were from 9-17 mon-fri. So I sent an email instead.I called again today to follow up on my email and was on hold waiting for 30mins!! until I got a tape saying hours were from 9-12! Like waiting in line at the cashier and when its your turn, cashier is saying sorry, I am closed.Edit 17/6/2020:After a second call the next day I got someone on the line and they would get back to me the same day. It wasn't until the day after I got a response after I've sent a second email. They have placed a new order/delivery as the second box was never sent out. Should be expecting it tomorrow. I am considering this flaw in customer service now a minor mishap. Am seeing already some improvements in their communications.

vivino	US	We've only had 1 bottle so far but it‚Ä¶	14 June 2020	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	We've only had 1 bottle so far but it was very good.  Someone brought a bottle to a gathering we had and it was very good so that's why we ordered it.  It was from 3 Palms though.  Didn't realize that was a different bottle.  It was still very good.
vivino	US	When I ordered	14 June 2020	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	When I ordered, I worried that my wine would not be from Napa as I believed it was advertised as.  I emailed but got no answer.  My worry proved to be correct, it's screw cap Sean Minor from Paspo Robles.  Now I've got 7 bottles of the stuff.Ed Macho

vivino	US	The wine delivered was a day late	11 June 2020	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	The wine delivered was a day late. Who knows how it was stored?? The ice had melted, and the package Inside and out was damaged. Wine wine was good, but if you spend a decent amount on a bottle(5) of wine, you have to expect a flawless delivery. We live in the south and wine subjected to heat rarely fares well. That said, I likely will not use this service again.

After over two weeks of back and forth with Vivino where I asked did they ever have the advertised Brut and if so, to exchange what was mistakenly sent, the only answer that I received was ‚ÄúI will check with the fulfillment center ‚Äú. It is as if I had ordered a Cabernet Sauvignon and received a Pinot Noir.  Both are red wines but are completely different. This was a ‚ÄòBait and Switch‚Äô scam. I will never by from them again.

vivino	DE	Wrong delivery + No customer service	29 May 2020	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	"Ordered two bottles of wine. The delivery was quick, but one of them was wrong. The delivered one was from the same winery and of the same grape variety as what I had ordered, but of different grade and vintage. According to Vivino's and other sellers' catalogue, the delivered one costs about half the price of what I ordered. I tried to ""reach out"". Contacted Vivino customer service by mail, app chat, and phone call; but no response at all. I know COVID-19 situation might be harsh. But is it that hard to simply refund or exchange wrongly delivered single bottle of wine?I still hope the refund or exchange happens sooner or later, so that I can give better star rating in the near future. But the negative reviews and the responses shown here, especially recent ones, are quite discouraging me."

The Edict Chardonnay did not disappoint, and the delivery time and service was excellent!
vivino	US	Great Offering	12 May 2020	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	Loved the pricing on a Willamette Valley Pinot - one rarely has an opportunity to buy a bottle for $30. Appreciate Vivino's curation as well - the wine is very good!  Finally, the quick and free delivery was great. In short, the quality, price, and service, of this offering make it easy to seriously consider future Vivino offerings.

vivino	DE	There is so much wrong with Vivino	02 May 2020	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	"There is so much wrong with Vivino. Let me give you a couple of examples:- awful customer service - you rarely get an answer to your questions- especially vintages sold by Vivino often have a lot of high ratings that don't make any sense at all (e.g. a Cabernet Sauvignon is rated ""Fantastic Shiraz!"") and scores seem to be pushed- basic information on wines is not always accurate and Vivino's own metrics are often absurd- a lot of Vivino reviews that I have seen here look ""artificial"" and over-enthusiasticI still use Vivino for wine checking, but would recommend to always double-check using other information and scores."

vivino	US	Delay and lack of support from Vivino	01 May 2020	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	After placing an order, I spent several weeks without any update from Vivino. I have contacted their customer support and they told me they would contact the seller to get information about my order. After another couple of days without updates from Vivino support, I have googled the seller and found their phone number. I could only get information about my order and get it shipped after I directly called the seller and requested an update. Finally, even though I have provided the correct address in the order, it was shipped to the wrong address, so I have to contact UPS and drive to the warehouse to pick it up. I certainly understand that there might be delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but Vivino support was useless and was not able to provide any information or to help me to get any information.

vivino	US	I live in NYC and ordered 12 bottles‚Ä¶	01 May 2020	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I live in NYC and ordered 12 bottles from vivino at the beginning of April 2020.  I was told the delivery may be delayed due to covid which was fine.  However, after 2 weeks with no response from them, they abruptly cancelled the order due to problems with ny delivery which was again understandable. My issue is that they will not refund the money for this purchase, and have had ample time to do so.  The app only delivers automated responses, and the responses are only generated in the middle of the night. They then claim that because you aren't responding that they are closing the ticket. They have kept this in limbo for a month now, and I have had to file a claim with my bank, and the ftc just to get them to pay attention. I would advise against using them in the future, and apparently Im not the only one who has had this problem with them.  A number of friends in NY are also experiencing the same thing.
vivino	GB	Poor customer service poor value	01 May 2020	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I have been using Vivino for a long time and have spent a fair amount of money with them but that doesn‚Äôt seem to cut any ice judging by recent events . I ordered several cases of different largely French wines . It turns out that Vivino are just Brokers Selling other companies wines. One wine in particular was a french Burgundy 2015 which I really fancied. Vivino took the order, took the money. Then , absolutely nothing. I called , twice, to be told they would look into it and email me back . Still nothing .they tell you who the merchant is so I called him and he sent me some wine . BUT not the wine I ordered and looked forward to. This wine was ¬£1.50 per bottle cheaper and the merchant said Vivino would refund me the difference. So far I have not heard a word from Vivino. No refund, no email no apology.So it‚Äôs now very simple; I WILL NEVER USE VIVINO AGAIN . I‚Äôm off to our local specialist wine store . Buyer beware . Vivino sell other people‚Äôs wine and you probably pay more than you need to .

I have the feeling I‚Äôm just our that money...Won‚Äôt be ordering again.
vivino	GB	Poor response to a delivery problem	30 April 2020	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	"Ordered 6x bottles of a red, for which I had been waiting expectantly to come on sale. Delivery was on time, but there were only 2 bottles in the box. I immediately emailed Vivino customer services, but received no response after 5 days, so re-sent my query and also logged a chat. Again, no response. I then called and spoke to an agent who said he would speak to the warehouse and ""get back to me"". There has been no response at the time of writing and surely it should have been a case of refunding me for the 4 missing bottles or arranging for them to be sent. Instead, I am ¬£100+ down and no idea if or when my issue will be dealt with, as any reasonable person could expect. Instead, all I get is a constant stream of marketing emails, recommending other products."

We ordered a case of wine for our daughter‚Äôs 25th birthday.  Within a minute of placing the order, I reached back out to Vivino with a correction in the address.  No reply.  Reached out multiple times when I was finally told that the order was being redirected to the correct address.  That was over three weeks ago. Multiple emails (replies typically take 3-4 days) and wait times on ‚Äúhold‚Äù over one hour.  Now I‚Äôm told that the case of wine that was being re-directed will be resent in separate packages and take over 2 more weeks.  Unbelievable.

The wine was delivered quickly and the Rioja was delicious. I kept on ordering more wine and then recently my experience became completely different. I ordered 6 bottles of white wine (Vuuberg 2017) more than 3 weeks ago. There is no update on my Order other than the Order has been placed. I have sent countless messages to customer services and tried to call the help number but all to vain! This is completely unacceptable. If the wine cannot be delivered then more than happy to cancel and buy other wines but the money has been taken (¬£110).

I live in Texas and that is what is on my account.  I have conversed with someone in your chat room on several occasions and they finally told me that your delivery partner sent it to the wrong address (state) and they were now going to resend it to me.  You already have my money, but I still do not have the wine.  As you can imagine, I am pretty dissatisfied and disappointed in Vivino's lack of service and ability to service my order.  Your response and delivery of the wine I have already paid for would be appreciated.

Is free shipping only applicable for all the same?

I find ordering from their suppliers is cheaper and much quicker.  My last order was over 2 weeks so I called the supplier and it's on it's way in a couple days.  The selection is wider using a number of wine shops but I prefer to support the folks paying the inventory carrying cost.** Update 4/28; still missing one of 3 cases that were supposedly shipped a month ago. Supplier frustrated with Vivino, poor or no communication and follow through

Zero communication what so ever. Tried to call, emailed, filled out a form on the website and still no response. The order was promised the latest by April 7th. What is the most dissapointing that they have already charged my credit card for the full amount but I have absolutely no idea if I will even receive my order and to this date has been unsuccessful in getting any information. I have no idea what I should do at this point, do I need to call my bank to dispute the charge?

The wine met all expectations and the price point was terrific.   The order shipped very quickly but as it needed to get to the midwest it took almost one week to arrive and we had left on  a trip the day it was delivered.   Was a bit challenging trying to reschedule delivery or set a pickup date with UPS as we were out for 12 days.  Finally got that resolved after several attempts. Delivery requires signature by someone at least 21 years of age.   I will plan better with my next purchase.

vivino	GB	Dreadful website	28 February 2020	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	Not really sure what Vivino is trying to be.  Is it a shop or a wine social media / info site?  As a sales site, it's fine but I'd prefer Wine-Searcher every time as it doesn't have preferred suppliers.  As a review site, it doesn't work as messes all the vintages up, so if you are looking for vintage specific info, it's really awkward to find.The site is just confused.
vivino	US	Don's trust this order site	28 February 2020	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Don's trust this order site.  I tried twice to order wine from the site and both times they accepted the order and charged my credit card.  About a week later each time they sent an email canceling the order. I then had to wait without wine for an additional week to week and a half to get my money back.  I attempted 4 different wines to order and each time they were unable to deliver.  simple shame

vivino	US	Good Wine but poor storage?	21 February 2020	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	This wine is wonderful and would normally rate it 5star but every bottle arrived with so much sediment even in first pour that I wondered if it was stored properly at Vivino.  It was highly embarrassing pouring a glass for guests with so much junk in the sides and bottom of the glass.  The corks also had white crystallized pieces where the cork touched the wine. So good wine but terrible vendor
vivino	US	Thanks for the wine I haven't drank it‚Ä¶	21 February 2020	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	Thanks for the wine I haven't drank it yet but I'm sure it tastes delish.My only problem was with the shipper UPS. Since it was wine it did require a signature which I knew. However when I tried to set up the delivery so that I could pick it up afterwork at a UPS location different then the warehouse since that was 9 miles away from my house and closed at 6pm, that's when it became a disaster. They tried to redeliver 3 times even after I called and told just to leave it and I would pick it up. So that meant the wine got moved and shaken even more. I buy from other wine distrubutors and they use FEDEX which does a great job in letting me pick up at different Fedex locations close to my home. Anyway thanks for the wine I will look forward to drinking it. Cheers

vivino	US	First wine purchase	19 February 2020	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	Vivino delivered our wine on time and priced as advertised. However, this was our first purchase so not enough time to rate fully. The wine we ordered was advertised as a $40, highly rated Pinot sold for $15 through Vivino. For a $40 wine, which I did see online for close to that price elsewhere, it is not a highly rated wine. But for $15, it's an avg Pinot. We tried 3 bottles just to make sure one or even two were not spoiled.

Delivery arrived exactly the day that I was told, in a box with all the bottles inside wrapped individually in a sturdy inflatable plastic. Perfect outcome.

When I called they said that it was a glitch in their system and that they would not be able to order the vintage that was shown.I won't be using them again."
vivino	US	I ordered a package of wine that never made it to my city	22 January 2020	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I ordered a package of wine, which was destroyed in transit.I had to explore what had happened as I was not initially told what happened. They then ordered a replacement order, which was also apparently destroyed in transit (one UPS, one Fedex). Weird.2 weeks later... I am being told that Vivino is investigating on my behalf if I will be refunded. Really? I have yet to have one of these packages of wine make it to my city. Beware
vivino	GB	Nice app but poor customer service and delivery	21 January 2020	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Purchased wine from Vivino last week but have accounted problems with the delivery which were then compounded by poor customer service.
vivino	US	The worst customer care ever! UPDATED	20 January 2020	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	The worst customer care service of any vendor ever. They sent me the wrong wine and one month later there is no resolution in sight.  I filed a dispute with my credit card and Vivino fooled me into withdrawing it promising an immediate credit which never came. Total fraud and deception.AFTER I POSTED, THIS VIVINO REACHED OUT TO ME AND IMMEDIATELY RESOLVED EVERYTHING. I appreciate it, but its unfortunate that it took this path to get their attention.  Thank you Trustpilot!

vivino	CA	Here in the Canadian market every wine‚Ä¶	16 January 2020	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	"Here in the Canadian market every wine on the site is listed as ""Save X%"". Meanwhile the wine is generally the same price or less in most retail locations so why not just drop this deceptive practice. It's insulting to purchasers to think that they can't do a simple Google search and discover they are saving 0%."

vivino	US	Ordering through Vivino was the worst experience.	14 January 2020	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	"Ordering through Vivino was the worst experience I've ever had. I'm not one to typically complain about things too much, but I received my order in early September. The wine must have leaked during shipping as the bright pink paper mache around the bottle was soaking wet. Its pink color stained the front label. I immediately submitted a ticket to Vivino to see what could be done about this. For the next several months, I received copy/pasted ""waiting for response from merchant"" emails nearly every week with no end in site. I did not receive one over the holidays, so I replied back to get hopefully a new update. I received an auto response that my ticket number had been closed. Wow. Who closed it?It really just feels like they were stringing me along until hopefully I would just go away.I'm at a lost for words for what else I can do now other than dispute the charge at this point. All I wanted was the bottle of wine available for purchase on their site."
vivino	GB	complete lack of communication once ordered	07 January 2020	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Ordered wine from this company on the 20th December thinking I would get it in time for my partners birthday on the 1st January. They took my money and then I heard nothing. I eventually had to contact them to see when I may expect my order, although I got a reply saying they would have to contact their merchant who was dealing with this, I found the whole experience extremely poor. Lack of communication being the biggest issue. I eventually got the wine very late in the day on December 31st, however I suspect if I had not chased it up I‚Äôd still be waiting. No offer of any form of recompense for the bad service, which in my opinion, should have been offered to perhaps keeping custom. Well not in this case, never again
vivino	GB	Buyer beware	30 December 2019	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Unreliable, unprofessional and inept. I had downloaded and used there app for a couple of weeks and found it helpful. If only I refrained from taking the next step and actually placed orders. Two orders placed, the first delivery was delayed by days without any update from their customer service team. Finally, I received my order and an emailed apology. The second order, placed In the lead up to Christmas and funds deducted Immediately   However, I‚Äôm still waiting for my wine. One week and three unanswered emails later, I tracked down a UK customer service number and after much waiting about the person‚Äôs explanation contradicted the information provided via the tracking service. A promise was made to deal with this as a matter of urgency yet I‚Äôm still no further forward. I‚Äôll be approaching my c/c company for a refund and let them deal with Vivino. Buyer beware!
vivino	US	String of bad reviews had me worried	19 December 2019	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	I placed a Vivino order online (I was not logged in when I placed the order).  I got nervous after finding I had no way to track my order and did a quick internet search for reviews of the Vivino wine delivery service.  After finding a recent long string of awful reviews here on Trustpilot I was more nervous.  An attempt to chat with a Vivino customer service rep confirmed my worst fears.. no response.  However, I left the chat session open and within a couple of hours an agent appeared and replied to me once every 15 minutes to half hour.  They were able to resolve my tracking issue and my wine arrived at it's destination within 2 days of when I had ordered it (the very earliest possible time in the estimated shipping window).  Overall I am satisfied with my Vivino experience.  I do not believe they are a scam and would order from them again.
vivino	GB	Excellent great service and fast‚Ä¶	18 December 2019	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Excellent great service and fast delivery I would buy from them again
vivino	ES	Truly bad	14 December 2019	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Truly bad. Delivery ok. Customer service does not exist. For the last delivery they charged me twice. I have tried to reach out to them by emails, chats, phone calls. No response. Haven‚Äôt got a proper reply from them and haven‚Äôt got my money back and not any explanation. I would not recommend them.
vivino	ES	Double charge	13 December 2019	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Have bought from this company a few times before and had good service and on the whole good value wine. Unfortunately if something goes wrong their customer service is non existent.  They charged me twice for my last order ( and belatedly have shipped twice) despite only one order being placed and confirmed. It is impossible to contact them to rectify this. Only option available is a phone number for customer support which is an answer machine that is full. Looking at other recent reviews fear they might have overstretched themselves and probably best to avoid them until they sort things out.
vivino	GB	Truly awful.	11 December 2019	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Truly awful. Much of the wine here can be bought for less and delivered in reasonable time rather than two weeks after it was ordered.As for the 'reviews'?A.N.Other is highly likely to be marketing the product you are reading about, working for Vivino, or otherwise employed by large scale distributors.If it didn't all leave such a bad taste in the mouth it would be funny.
vivino	US	Has been 5 days since my order	06 December 2019	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Has been 5 days since my order, tried to contact them about shipping, and get no response.  They were very eager to immediately charge my credit card and take my money, but provide absolutely no customer service.  There are too many good options for buying wine, avoid this retailer.
vivino	GB	Borderline Scam, avoid	05 December 2019	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	There is no way to contact them, I ordered 3 bottles of wine and have recieved none of them. They provide a phone number that goes to a machine which then just puts down, you cannot leave a message. They claim to have delivered 2 bottles, but not to me (if at all)! The other order appears lost and cannot be tracked.  Avoid, not worth it!
vivino	US	11/29/2019 My experience is that Vivino is a dishonest company which uses false advertising to lure customers to their website.	29 November 2019	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	"11/29/2019Vivino sent me an email headlined ""Black Friday Takes Dead Aim at The Prisoner!"" with a subtext ""Under $30 Sharpshooter Hits the Bullseye!""  Then 2 prices, each with a strike-out $50 and $32.99, affirming the price is under $30.I go to place an order using the given code and the price never goes below $32.99.The chat person wants me to place the order and then contact them with a tracking order number to ask for a ""one time courtesy"" credit.    Courtesy?  One time? I didn't want a courtesy.  I wanted them to live up to their advertised price, and do so in the checkout.  Otherwise Vivino is screwing any customers who don't catch it.  And then the courtesy wasn't even a credit for the full difference between the advertised price and what the checkout wanted to charge me. And, why would I trust they would honor that credit promise when their advertising is false and when trust has been eliminated from the transaction.And, the chat person implied, but didn't say, that i should be happy because the $32.99 price was a 45% discount from retail.  We all know their ""retail"" prices are bogusly high.  They probably paid $19.99 and roughly triple that in claiming what the retail price is.$3/btl isn't a big deal even when applied to 3 bottles.  But i learned long ago that ""when principle is involved, be deaf to expediency.""I hate it when a company uses false advertising to lure customers to the site only to renege on an offered deal.  I wasted 60 minutes on this and had to wait a dozen or minutes between some contacts in chat. Had to take screenshots and send them to the chat person. It was a frustrating, hassled and disappointing experience. Don't do business with Vivino.  They are a dishonest company.As an aside, Trustpilot should have 0 (zero) stars, not 1 star, as the lowest number of stars choices.This is in response to  Bernadett from the Vivino Customer Experience team, since I can't figure out how to ""reply"" directly to her question.There is no order number to share because I didn't place the order.  I didn't place the order because the offered price of ""less than $30/btl"" never appeared in the checkout process.  Did you even read my complaint? Check with ""Beth"" as she was the person I chatted with."

vivino	US	Never received all of wine	21 November 2019	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I ordered bottles of wine and was fully charged.  Never received 3 of them and also received 3 of the wrong wines in place of a much more valuable wine.  Even after 4 weeks of customer service nothing has been resolved (no refunds, no replacements).  They refuse to refund me even though the company Vivino brokered the deal with has agreed that Vivino has messed up and given me all the proof necessary.  Calls and emails seem to do nothing as it is just some outsourced office with no actual company backing that keep saying their manager isn't in the office.  He/She obviously doesn't exist.
vivino	GB	Excellent	20 November 2019	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Fantastic service offered
vivino	US	Don't do business with these people	20 November 2019	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Don't do business with these people. They don't provide the wine, they're just a middleman and when something goes wrong, they won't advocate for you they just defer to their 'supplier'. I bought six bottles of wine from Vivino that were 'cooked'. Stored improperly and all the bottles leaked. Vivino was of zero assistance other than to offer a coupon for future purchases. I returned the wine and their 'supplier' lied to say they never received the return. Buy from a vendor that stands behind their product and offers customer service. That would be someone other than Vivino.
vivino	US	Multiple bad experiences X20OQJOG	14 November 2019	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I had terrible service from a previous order and they finally tried to resolve it with a 15% off coupon but when I went to make my next order.. the same thing happened.  THEN, after I emailed them back twice about ONE bottle out of TWENTY FOUR not being in stock, they canceled my order.. AFTER they had charged my credit card.  They would only call during work hours to tell me that one bottle wasn't in stock.  I told them twice that they could replace the bottle and charge any increase (which would only have amounted to a few dollars).  Now, not only was I unable to use the 15% off, but now, I won't get my wine in time for the holidays and I have to wait however long to get a refund.  No one will get back to me... their phone only lets you leave a message, and their customer service won't reply or help.*Received a refund only after filing a formal complaint with the BBB.  I have yet to get any response from them.  I am appalled at their horrible treatment and inability to own up to their mistakes.

Received a shipping notice but only received 2 bottles. I have been emailing and calling them; I sent them photos of the shipment per their request, but all I get is that they are waiting for their partner's response; in this case it is wine.com.I called wine .com and was told that I have to deal with Vivino. The only response I get from Vivino is thank you for your patience, we are waiting for response from partner merchant. This is ridiculous. This should not take more than an hour to resolve. I will never buy again from Vivino; they have no ability to support their transaction....
vivino	US	If I could give less than one star I‚Ä¶	30 October 2019	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	If I could give less than one star I would.  I ordered a case of wine to be delivered to a friends house as a gift.  It was supposed to be delivered in 3-4 business days.  Two weeks later, when it still hasn't been shipped, I finally reach a live human being (not an easy task).  They tell me that 5 of my bottles are not available, but they never bother to contact me to let me know.  They tell me to choose 5 substitute bottles, which I do, but I can't reach anyone to let them know my choices.  They don't respond to emails or phone calls.  Horrible customer service experience!
vivino	US	Not worth the discount, horrible if not Trumpian service	25 October 2019	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I have had reasonable success with Vivino in the past, but once you need customer service you will be disappointed. I bought 1 Corison and 11 bottles of Worthy wine (mostly to avoid shipping costs and I have enjoyed Worthy 2010), opened one Worthy the night it arrived. Corked/spoiled/nasty vinegar. These things happen. Opened 3 more--all nasty and undrinkable. Emailed them but didn't get a response. Thought that they would trust me on my word having bought many orders of wine from them in the past. Opened the other 7 and they were the same or worse. Clearly not stored properly or tainted at the time of bottling etc. Emailed them again, and waited for their reply regarding refund. Eventual response was that they had to contact their source and get back with me. I said I bought the wine from Vivino, not some other vendor they contract with. Vivino owes me the refund. I would settle for being able to watch them drink the swamp fluid they sent, but nobody deserves that. Another week or so has gone by and I pinged them again. Next response was that I should not have opened them all so they only will refund $150 of the $329. Now I am waiting for a return call. I did call the source vendor and they are trying to advocate on my behalf and find a solution. No problems with them, only Vivino.  Summary--Vivino won't stand by their product and are unreasonable to work with.Why does Vivino require negative reviews and fraud claims with MasterCard before you get service Jackie?

vivino	US	What Happened to Your Wines	13 October 2019	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I ordered wines from your company early in September. They were shipped on September 13th, 2019. I paid $262.16 for 4 bottles of wine. I paid for ice packs, however, when I opened the box, there was only one small cooling pack for the wines, and the wines were HOT. You stated that you would let me know when my box was to arrive and I was supposed to sign for it, but I was not told when it was to come, nor was I required to sign for it. Your company says that you, ‚Äúuse careful delivery right to my doorstep‚Äù ... not the case this time.I believe there should have been several ice packs for a box that size. I wrote to your company and communicated with a Daph P. I have not heard anything back from him in two weeks now. I asked what you planned to do. He said earlier that they still had the wine in stock and would replace it. I told him that was fine or a credit to my account either way (Sept. 29th.)  I said how sorry I was that this mistake happened to these wines. I suggested that next time they pack more ice packs with them. This error is definitely to fault of the company or whoever packed the wines. I have ordered very expensive wines before from other venues and Never had any problems at all (they have Always been packed correctly with multiple cold packs). Perhaps, you could just credit my account for the amount and call it done.I trust you will make the right decision, as this has not been a good experience, and your support team has let you down (they haven‚Äôt been here to help me).Ellen Kavanagh 315 Meadowbrook Terrace Greensboro, N.

vivino	US	I made a purchased on 9/30 and vivino‚Ä¶	02 October 2019	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I made a purchased on 9/30 and vivino were so quick to take money out of my account and then they send me a order # stating it the information were sent to FedEx and when I called FedEx they stated that they have no receive anything from the shipper yet so my question is what the hell is the delay. This is frustrating because I ordered this according to the time that I would receive it because I have an event to go to on 10/4 thinking that I would receive it by then. This is absolutely ridiculous and I couldn't even locate anyone when I tried to call customer service. I am very upset on how Vivino handle there business and couldn't follow up with the shipment on time but they are so quick to take money out of my account. If my package doesnt arrive before Friday I will need a refund or else I will have to take this matter to a higher up who values their customer

Vivino blames the carrier, Parcelforce, for the mistake, Parcelforce did the opposite and it took weeks for a refund to arrive in my account for the non delivery. To insult to injury Parcelforce are now asking to collect the missing parcel from my address instead of the East London one.

vivino	US	Nearly a month ago	08 July 2019	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Nearly a month ago, on June 12 I ordered three cases of wine from Vivino.  Only one has been delivered.  The other two cases totalling $1200 are lost in Vivino limbo.  I've now sent them multiple emails inquiring status, most of which have been ignored completely with no response at all.  In one of the few responses from Francis B., even though I'd forwarded the original order confirmation for the three cases from Vivino along with my inquiry, he emailed me telling me their records only showed an order for one case.  When I resent the order confirmation for the 3 cases again on June 27, they've now just gone dark and haven't responded at all.  I am at wits end, Vivino.  Can someone please tell me what's going on?

Four different times I received emails saying the delivery ""would take place tomorrow"".  Absolutely nothing arrives and I do not receive a call or a note from Vivino or their delivery company.I call customer support and while they are incredibly patronising, they basically say the problem is with the delivery company and they will call me back when they have spoken with the delivery company (Parcel Force).I never receive a call back from Vivino Customer Support. I have to chase them.After 3 weeks I call Vivino Customer Support to cancel the order and request a refund.A refund is promised - but a week later: absolutely no refund and certainly no delivery.Poor delivery service, with an indifference that is only exceeded by the patronising Customer Service."

vivino	US	Mismatches, and...more mismatches	08 June 2019	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	"This is not a fair review. I know. Vivino customer service has done a good job 81% of the times. But the problem is that, as a customer, you get tired of mismatches, wrong vintages and so on. They advertise good deals that they are sometimes mismatches, so whenever you order, you never know if you will get the same vintage or even the same wine. You don't believe it? As an app to check wines works great. As a member actively ordering wines through them, they make mistakes. And this last one was more annoying than others basically because of their unresponsiveness and not very caring customer service. The thing is I ordered 3 bottles of wine X per $30 each and I got 3 bottles of wine Y, a totally different wine. I emailed Vivino support with this issue, and took them a couple weeks at least to let me know what happened. And what happened was, according to their customer service, that ""it was a mismatch, you paid $30 for each bottle and the merchant sent you those ones since the ones you wanted were more expensive"". Great, right? You want that wine BUT, since the price was a mistake, you get another one you would never buy. Then, the process of returning the wines. They will extend a refund once the merchant gets the wines. And who cares about all the time you spend, picking up wrong wines, printing labels, dropping off the package again? Not them. Overall, a month and a half since I originally processed the order until I finally got a refund. Worth it? Definitely not. I emailed them a couple times just expressing my disappointment and customer service even closed the conversation in the app, with no response. Now, what happens is every time I want to order something, I think it twice and I usually end up getting the wines somewhere else."

However it has one major shortcoming:The prices quoted are totally unreliable since the management has decided to lump together prices paid in restaurants and prices paid at the Vintners or elsewhere.  The upshot is that, depending on whether the majority of subscribers have bought their wine at a restaurant, a grocery or direct from the vintner, The average price quoted for a given year can be three times the price for the following year!

vivino	CA	The write ups on their wines are very misleading	04 May 2019	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	The write ups on their wines are very misleading. They tie the actual wine for sale to another completely different wine/vintage/region. 100 point winery! 98 point region! And they use hacks like Luca Maroni to post big scores. Luca 98 is a WS 86. And who is Thomas Stafford? A level one part time Som giving out 95‚Äôs left and right?Vivino Canada is not an honest broker of wine. Selling Honda Civics described as Acura NSX‚Äôs, backed by paid for hacks. Buyer beware.

Do not order wine from Vivino.I saw several reviews of ""bait and switch"" and I have to agree! This is exactly what happened to me. Trust me, they aren't doing this by mistake. The vintage they are sending is much cheaper and NOT what you ordered!Vivino tried to tell me that they can substitute for a different year. There was absolutely nothing on my receipt or packing slip that states this. I sent them a copy. (Vivino requested this to show them, as if they don't have the same copy?)Good luck getting in touch with customer service as well. When you finally do, they drag it on forever and it's like pulling teeth for them to do anything to help you.I had to ask for a return label over 4 times and finally had American Express step in and get my money refunded. Vivino did absolutely nothing to make the return easy and I received no compensation for my hours of wasted time. I wish I could give Vivino 0 stars,"

Of course you cant call anyone on a weekend but it said it will take 3-4 biz days to confirm so I thought no worries Ill call on monday. In the mean time I canceled online and wrote to their CS 3 times telling them please cancel here is order # blah blah blah the info they need to cancel. I called on Monday morning at 10 am to verify they got this. One person in CS emailed me at 5am PST and said it was cancelled. I called at 10am to verify. I was told they would look into this and take care of it. Then I get an email at 3pm PST saying my order has shipped!?? I called back, asked for supervisor a second time , first time at 10am he was in a meeting, at 3pm he was still in a meeting? lol, Can I have his voice mail? Sorry we dont have VM I was told, She was going into the meeting and having her supervisor call me right away. Still waiting 30 min later, Of course I have all day to deal with this .   This all started when I tried to order a 2014 vintage that showed on their website, when I ordered a case of what I thought I was getting it switched to 2015 not 2014. The lady hasnt been rude to me but they definately dont have a good cancellation protocol in place. If you order tripe check and be sure or you will be waiting 10 days for a refund most likely.Chad this case of wine is sitting at my house, how do I return it now?Chad, did you get my response about Fed Ex?I am updating my review to 3 stars. Although the ordering confusion was trying , the customer service from Chad was excellent. He had the wine picked up immediately and refunded my cost and it posted back in my account in about 3 days. Thanks again Chad for taking care of this, Michael

Better to have a follow up question . Did you buy one and the option , then, to select and keep a wine with the other scanned items being automatically deleted would work better for me. It should be easy to change the app accordingly.

Silly me for thinking it would just be delivered but UPS needed a signature for alcohol deliveries. I had to leave for 15 minutes to get my son from school and of course the driver came in that tiny windowAnyway mention of this as far as I can tell on the website. So UPS then said they would deliver the next day so my son and I stayed home all day, calling UPS frequently, who said it was on the truck and would be delivered. It wasn't. It was eventually delivered the next Monday but I stayed home two days, had to buy wine from the liquor store for our dinner party. Better off going to the liquor store. I think with the cost of the wine and my two days at home the 6 bottles cost me about $900.

vivino	GB	The best service is the rating of wines I am buying or have bought.	08 March 2019	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	The best service is the rating of wines. Individual reviews are sometimes helpful, but the overall rating system has proved very reliable. What is not appreciated is the ongoing effort to sell wines. The persistant, unremitting effort to sell wine is objectional and moreover calls into question the objectivity and lack of bias in ratings. Question: if you rate wines on one side and then sell wines on the other, how long before the ratings are effected by sales?

I only follow a few people, but love reading what others write about wines and the terms used.....I've learned a lot this way.The only thing that would be nice is to organize ""my wines"" into different categories, ratings etc. For example, listing all my 5 star wines first etc. But this doesn't affect the use of the app...it's still great!!!"

vivino	US	Good offerings, poor shipping execution	07 March 2019	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	Good offerings, but mixed experience with shipping.  UPS is awful in my area, damaging packages and making deliveries requiring signatures inconvenient -- so I asked if they could only ship via FedEx (as they used to do).  They said yes, if I promptly notified them of the need after my order was confirmed; but then they shipped UPS anyway claiming that my request (fewer than 60 seconds after receiving order confirmation) came too late.  So, I now buy elsewhere.
vivino	US	My experience with Vivino has not been‚Ä¶	07 March 2019	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	My experience with Vivino has not been good. I was in aruba.  Found a wine i loved. Went on my vivino app and took a photo.  The cost of the wine popped up then it asked if i wanted to order it.which i did. The problem is that the picture was of a 2013 bottle and vivino shipped me a different year. With wines that matterrs. I went back and forth with Vivino customer service explaining the issue.  And instead of going back to the photo i . ordered from, they instead tried to tell me i ordered a different year, which is absurd because i never tried the other years. What vivino should have done when they didn't have the year i ordered was give me the optio. They instead simply shipprd a different year thinking it was ok. So i told the customer service person to be fair i will try a bottle of this wine.  If its the same i will keep the case. If not im sending back the other 11 bottles.And if you check my acct you will see vivino did the same EXACT thing to me on an expensive wine A FEW MONTHS AGO.Not a nice way to do business.

vivino	US	No hassle purchase return	07 March 2019	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	For the first time after 5 years buying through Vivino I received 6 bottles of a highly rated Pinot noir. The first bottle (first sip) tried was undrinkable (flavorless and flat) so I notified Vivino who immediately refunded my costs which I applied to my next purchase. No hassle, no time wasted, just an apology for the condition of the wine. If other merchants were similarly responsive we‚Äôd have a better world.

What would be nice if you can take the photo, after identification then drop into cellar at a designated location.Under my wines, there is no search function to find a particular wine that I have.

vivino	US	Vivino has some terrific wine offers‚Ä¶	07 March 2019	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Vivino has some terrific wine offers and a wonderful selection of reds.  A friend told me about Vivino close to a year ago and I've purchased a few cases of myraid reds.  I've been very happy with all the wines and the convenience of having it delivered to my door instead of purchasing at a store and then having to drag them home is great!  The only thing I don't like is that you cannot put different brands in one cart and then make your purchase.  Each cart has to be the same brand of wine and if it's a different brand, it goes into a separate cart.  I don't understand why this is, but it's very frustrating and I imagine I'm not the only Vivino customer who feels this way.  It might be a good idea to rethink this issue and revise your purchasing procedure.Cheers!

What keeps this from a 5 star app are 1) the trend toward grade inflation so there are too many wines between 3.5 and 4.5 stars, and 2) the general hassles of online ordering when there is a corked bottle. My friends at local wine and spirits stores know me and there is no question when I bring in a dud.  I acknowledge that having the wine delivered to my door can be convenient and a plus for the online side, though my social side likes the personal touch of the wine seller that is not possible with a click and ship approach.

In the world according to Vivino, EVERY wine they offer is off the charts awesome, and is a must buy! Be careful, and do your own research. Other than that, there are some good deals to be had if you look hard enough, and know what you're looking for. I would have given them 4 stars, except they don't give shipping options at the point of sale! I always need FedEx, but am not given the choice, and getting that message across has been futile and cumbersome. Remember, you aren't buying from Vivino, you are buying from their suppliers (liquor stores). That in my opinion is the disconnect. I order, and then reply to the confirmation email with shipping instructions. That email goes to Vivino customer service, and usually by the time they reach the supplier with my instructions, it is too late! Why they don't just give the option on the order is beyond me...
vivino	US	Awesome	07 March 2019	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Awesome! I love that I can take a picture of a wine menu at a restaurant and get instant ratings! I love that I have my whole cellar stored in one place. I love that if I drink a wine at a friends house that I like I can take picture, get info and buy it immediately! So many uses and so well made.

I literally could not drink even a portion of the wine and I dumped the bottle. Very embarrassing to serve guests a bad wine. Now I have 5 bottles remaining.

vivino	US	Getting better and better	07 March 2019	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Love the scanning and buying experience on Vivino. Especially now that they have expanded to show external buying options and cellar tracking. I do wish the cellar tracking was more ‚Äúfront and center‚Äù (less clicks to get to the details), provided an option to record cellar location, and to scan multiple bottles into my cellar inventory at onc. Great progress though
vivino	US	I always get my orders within two days	07 March 2019	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	I always get my orders within two days, and I am very happy with not only your prices, but the great quality of the wine you offer.  I will continue to purchase from your company. However, I once received a shipment of the wrong wine from you, and I was told (via email, because you have no customer service number on your web site) to take pictures of the wrong wine bottles to prove that you sent me the wrong wine. I sent the pictures and then waited for another email on your decision to replace the wine. I felt like I was being treated like some kind of low life that trying to screw your company. I was disturbed and frustrated that you do not have live customer service department and/or a telephone number listed on your web site that I could have called in order to resolve this issue quickly.  It would have saved me and your company a lot of time and frustration.For your information, I built two highly successful companys over 20 years, ( in fact the 4th largest  privately owned company in the Bay Area) and the one thing I knew early on was to have live people  to work with customers to solve their issues. I encourage you to do the same.  You have a great model and it will help you grow your business.

First they promote the sale of certain wines which they feature to the vivino community. I do not trust any of their ratings for these wines with good reason. The most obvious is more often then not the scores are not for the wine they are selling but as the small print indicates, ""for all vintages."" We all know the extreme variations within vintages and these scores are used instead of the actually vintage score where no reviews exist or the scores are low. In addition, the scores of the professional sommeliers Vivino hirers are usually inconsistent with ratings you will find on cellartracker and other sites.Vivino""s other two functions, a market place for retailers and scanning of wine bottles to determine scores and available retailers, they do very well."

vivino	US	Trying to be helpful	07 March 2019	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	You need to share reviews that are pertinent to the wine you‚Äôre selling NOT an average of vintages of the wine over a number of years. Also, you should engage more non employee members (who have educated reviews and decerning experienced palettes) to inform buyers in a non biased way as to the quality of your wines being sold. Certainly, wine is such an individual experience but having diversified opinions of buyers and experts will only improve the experience of your buyers so as not to be disappointed with there purchases. This can only lead to a greater credibility and satisfaction for your buyers.

vivino	US	Have stopped buying mainly due to poor delivery service	07 March 2019	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	Have stopped buying mainly due to non-availability of shippers except UPS.  Wine shipments require a signature, which is a big inconvenience with UPS as someone has to stay home all day.  If you know you will be out of town, they charge $5 to customer who is only extending them the courtesy of moving delivery to another day as opposed to letting UPS attempt a delivery only to have to come back again (I stopped moving delivery dates as charging is an insult).  FedEx will deliver to home or FedEx (Kinkos) location or Walgreens for later pick up.  For some reason, Vivino does no allow customers to specify FedEx or even have an area for special instructions on web site.  Plenty of customer oriented alternatives to Vivino.

My wife and a few sommeliers helped me along the way and then I discovered Vivino. I use this app almost every other day to find new wines, compare wines, or look in my cellar to see where I can diversify my collection. I‚Äôve taken the app to many wine snobs and showed them the scanning feature and they were blown away by it. This is one of the best apps. I love the daily emails that have gotten me to buy very cool and special bottles at great prices. Gives me the opportunity to try things outside of the winery that I am a member of.

Any ya-hoo can get on there and say what they want. I wish there was an expert opinion associated with each bottle. All the midrange bottles I buy end up begin around 3.5 stars, and I think because there are so many people commenting, it becomes useless.

I would love to have this be able to just scan the UPC off the wine , but i also realize that many wines bought from the source do not have UPC codes of course.  When i the app cant find a wine the Vivino review team have come though within a few hours most times.  The Number of product pushing emails is not over bearing, and i do like the information that is provided for each wine. I use this to buy wine at Costco alllllll the timmmmmeeeee :)

Typically, I will use it when looking for a new wine to try or to find the best deal by comparing ratings on lower priced wines ($12-$20) with those priced higher. I have not been disappointed with any of the results from using Vivino.

I include in that category customers who are accustomed to the more expensive wines. But not so in our case. We are fortunate in Dallas to have some very good discount purveyors that deal in the price and quality of the wines we purchase. We look for reasonably good table wines (cab s) under ten dollars. Vivino has shown us what appears to be good cab bargains under ten dollars. However, after paying for shipping Vivino's offering isn't more competitive than what we can buy locally (a good Cab S table wine). Thanks for your offerings but we will unsubscribe to your program.

vivino	US	I have really LOVED this app	06 March 2019	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	I have really LOVED this app! I have been a faithful user to catalogue all my wine & wine ratings for the last 4 yrs. Furthermore, I absolutely love the deals that I am sent and do practically ALL my shopping downwind through the email deals I am sent. Few bummers:- you changed the layout of the app ~2yrs ago which puts the marketplace up front. I get it, but opening directly to My Wines was WAY more convenient!- the layout change also adds an extra step to searching for a wine in My Wines that is really annoying. I used to just be able to open the app, hit the magnifying glass and type in the wine I wanted to rate. Now there's like 2-3 more steps - not very great after a couple bottles of wine! [I'd have given 5 stars if not for the above] - shipping used to ALWAYS be via FEDEX. Because I travel a lot, this was incredibaly convenient as I could go to the FEDEX store near my house and pick up the wine on my own schedule (no one's ever home to sign for the wine). It would be VERY helpful to either choose what delivery service (FEDEX or UPS) to use for the shipment, OR at least communicate which company is going to be used AT THE TIME OF SALE so I can put the correct shipment address!Thanks for having such a GREAT App!Jack ScharrettC: 763-607-2878
vivino	US	Vivino Messed Up	06 March 2019	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	Vivino messed up the shipment date of my order.   The wine that I ordered was not advertised as a ‚Äúpre-order‚Äù √≠tem. However, when I contacted Vivino and inquired about the status of my wine (since I had received no shipping information after several days), I was told that the wine was ‚Äúpre-order‚Äù and not yet in the possession of the fulfillment center.    In trying to salvage that situation things only got more complicated, since I was going to be out of town and not available to sign for the order. A lag in communication with Vivino was most certainly a factor.   Not sure I will do business with Vivino in the future. Probably not. Many other, more reliable, options are available.

But when i changed recipient to a sick friend, who would be cheered up by wine, Vivino did a poor job.  I was specific about the delivery date, but was disappointed they did not honor my request.  Customer service was very concerned, but the delivery was well over a week late.  I would rate Vivino a mixed bag, but not a way to order wine needed by a fixed date.

vivino	US	A bit of bait and switch with Vivino	05 March 2019	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	A bit of bait and switch with Vivino. Generally, they have one rating on the come-on page and a lower rating on the order page. This happens way to often. Addiitionally, it is very common for them to show a rating on the come-on page and then when you pull it up, there is only one (and sometimes none) rating on that vintage and the rating is actually ‚Äúbased on all vintages.‚Äù I also feel that the professional sommelier reviewers are just selling their ratings. When you take most of the wines and search other  sites, the reviews are lower and the prices are as good and sometimes lower.Overall, interesting to read and occasionally some good deals, but not overly reliable. Do your own homework and don‚Äôt rely on the inflated reviews here (especially on the first page!).
vivino	US	Fantastic Wine app!	05 March 2019	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Perfect and keeps getting better. I can take a pick of the label and it tells me all about the wine.

It can read wine menus or even quickly snap pics of a dozen bottles at the wine store and show me the ratings. I can download my stuff to excel as a backup, I can sort.

vivino	US	Untrustworthy	05 March 2019	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	Not a reliable source for wine. Customer service is slow to respond and makes you jump through hoops when something goes wrong during the shipping process. Most of their vendors do not take care of the wine, often kept in uncontrolled liquor stores (fine if you're ordering a $20 bottle, but they're storing $200-1500 bottles completely exposed). I would hope that Vivino would vet each vendor beforehand - at least rate the way they store the wine.

You do have to take note, though, of how many reviewsmake up the rating, as those with very few reviews can be a bit skewed.  Fabulous app, I recommend it highly.

vivino	US	An Easy way to track the winners and losers	05 March 2019	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	"If you are like me and have a hard time recalling the various wines you've tried and many times not sure of which wine to buy, the Vivino App is may be for you. It's a easy & GREAT way to track the winners and losers, ensuring you buy more of the winners and steer clear of the losers. You can easily snap a picture of the wine label and watch Vivino log it inito ""My wines"". You can then rate the wine, leave your own personal notes (not displayed to the public) and keep track of what you paid, where you bought it etc. When looking for a wine you've tried in the past, It makes it much easier to find when standing in that sea of bottles in the liquor store. You can also use it to lookup unknown wines if you're unsure of what to buy. If you're a avid wine drinker, it's definitely worth a try. The ratings aren't always accurate and you have to take into account how many reviews a wine will have and be aware of who writes the review. Then again, wine is a personal preference - so you cannot bank on Vivino getting that perfect bottle of wine every time, but at least it helps vs. being totally clueless. BTW: You can also buy wines find very good deals on new, old and hard to find wines."

I would like to know the alcohol levels of the wines as they are often a deciding factor in purchasing. I want to have a more flexible return policy for buying wines that I have not tasted. I order less often than I used to. Some have been everything, or almost everything as described and expected. Some have been disappointing. Lastly the hyperbolic ratings and descriptions are distracting. There can be three or 4 different ratings for the same wine on the site. I always consult different sources of ratings because of this.  Associations with stellar wines and winemakers are also distracting because they are different but the implication is that they are the same or similar enough to merit the comparison. They often are not. Thank you again for a good way to buy wine at a discount.

vivino	US	Good and getting better	05 March 2019	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	Love the app.  The recommendations so far have been very close to my preferred taste profile.  Recommendations going forward would be to make the ratings scale more granular - half stars don‚Äôt give me enough description between a mediocre wine and a really good one.  I would also like that level of granularity to help my memory when I look back on decisions of whether to buy a particular wine again or not.  Other suggestion would be to add provisions (separate section) in your app for spirits and beer.  With the numbers of craft beers (and whiskey) on the market these days, we need a score card to keep track.

vivino	US	A recent purchase of a wine recommended‚Ä¶	05 March 2019	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	A recent purchase of a wine recommended on your site (Artful Farmer - Napa Red Wine), was fine if you like chunks of grapes in your glass.  I mean, literally nearly whole grapes. This was not as advertised, a blend of top notch, small batch wines from different vineyards under a cover label.  This was the dregs of the barrel.  I've opened 2 of my 6 bottles and both were the same.  I know what unfiltered wined can mean, but this is beyond the pale.  I made both of them into vinegar, maybe I can get some use out of them that way.  I just don't need 6 bottles of vinegar... what to do with the other 4?  A complete waste of money.  I should have stuck with my past experience with another of your competitors, Don't buy anything based on the sites recommendation.  Only buy if you know the wine already.Since this review, Vivino contacted me, returned the wine and gave me credit.  They (Yanyan and Chad) were helpful and timely with their response.  I appreciate the response and would consider purchasing something again.

vivino	US	Almost like a wine club without the required shipments	05 March 2019	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	"While its not the same experience as walking into your local wine shop for the instant gratification of discovering (and consuming) a great bottle wine, I have enjoyed my experience with Vivino.  Over the last year I have purchased around 70 bottles from this website with little to no issues.  It can be cumbersome having the packages delivered with the 21 and up signature requirement, but that would be the same for all wine deliveries.  I have also experienced a couple of late shipments due to their ""wine shop partners"" shipping departments, but their customer service has always responded quickly to my inquiries.   Vivino has been a good way for me to find excellent values on wine.  I have gambled on a few and some did not turn out as well as others.  For example the 12 bottles I purchased of the Angela Pinot Noir did not meet my expectations, but it was about par for a $20 Pinot.  Others like the Harmonique Oppenlader (never heard of the wine) left me wishing I had purchased every bottle in stock!  A couple of recommendations:  1.  Check the wines on other websites before you order.  This will give you an idea if you can buy the same bottle for the same price at Total Wine.  2.  Find a reviewer that that has the same wine preferences as you.  Some reviews are way over hyped, but remember it is only someone's opinion.  Try to find someone that agrees with you about what wines are good. All in all I have found Vivino to be very responsive and a great way to purchase wine at a good to great value."

My wine has been delivered in fine condition, on time, with no problems.However, in recent months the advertising and verbiage in the online ads has been increasingly aggressive and exaggerated, and the ratings appear to be overblown and deceptive.I am still a customer, but I have to be very careful not to be carried away by excessive praise for the offerings.

You are on the verge of losing my business because of the lack of responsiveness. Recently, I wrote to say that you didn‚Äôt apply the discount code advertised in the email to my order at checkout. Instead of doing so, you canceled my wine order (shipment) altogether. That‚Äôs a pitiful way to treat a loyal customer.

I contacted Vivino a few times on each of these occasions to rectify the situation and never heard back from them.  I had to contact the wineries directly and Delectus Winery was the only one to fix it by sending me 3 bottles to replace their bad ones.  Never heard back from the other winery, nor from Vivino.  As far as I'm concerned, Vivino owes me 2 bottles.  They will gladly take your money, but if there is an issue, there is no response.

vivino	US	I have been using Vivino for just over‚Ä¶	04 March 2019	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I have been using Vivino for just over a year, and cannot say enough positive about the wines offered and their service.  Vivino consistently offers me (via email) a wide variety of wines that are well suited to my interests and that are very competitively priced.  Their descriptions are very accurate, and I have not yet been disappointed.  Further, the website is easily searchable if you are looking for something specific, whether it is a varietal, a country of origin or otherwise.  Service has been terrific.  You receive an immediate email confirmation, and then a shipping confirmation that links you to the day of delivery.  (I also have not received any products damaged during shipment.)  There are other online wine vendors, and I've tried a few.  These guys guys are tops.

However, I do believe that the breadth of their wine offerings is excellent as is the ease of use for ordering off their site.  While getting in contact with them/customer service can be challenging, for most straightforward orders, the simple user interface, great selection of wines, excellent graphics and information, and speedy order form is second to none.  I do highly recommend Vivino for anyone placing orders of wine on a regular basis and looking to source a wide and rich selection of wines.

vivino	US	GREAT service and amazing wine‚Ä¶	04 March 2019	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	GREAT service and amazing wine selection- I rarely get a wine that I don‚Äôt like. I have ordered from Vivino when I lived in Italy and now the US and only had one or two wines I didn‚Äôt like. The discount codes, when given, are great- keep them coming more often. The more discount codes, the more volume people will buy- at least, that‚Äôs what I do because more volume equals free shipping and the code is the icying on the cake.They should also re-visit a membership program that includes free shipping. I know that initially, what they had didn‚Äôt fit the business model good but maybe, they can have certain levels of memberships based on purchasing volume of the person...the more volume, the less bottles needed for free shipping or a combination of what I mentioned in conjunction with an annual membership fee.

vivino	US	Excellent info and options.	04 March 2019	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Vivino is excellent at sharing information and providing options.  I have purchased a fair amount of wine from the website, and overall, I have been happy with my purchases.  That said, there are two caveats:  (1) I am a bit cautious with the sommelier's rating(s); and (2) I am gaining some skepticism on those bottles that make great claims and have great pedigrees, but are actually unknown brands.  But, even with those two caveats, I do recommend Vivino to all of my friends.

I find that the wines are touted as very very good and compared to famous vineyards, but then they are rated by people that are not among the best wll known, the wines come from vineyards that are close but not the actual top vineyards, and at the end, when I have tasted, for example, a Amarone that you touted as being among the top of the top, they are not. They are decent, not close to dal forno romano or other of that quality. Yes they are where are  cheaper, I grant you that.

vivino	US	I'm happy with everything in the app - just hate all the email.	04 March 2019	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	I'm happy with everything in the app - it seems to do everything I want it to do (log and track my wines and help create an environment to discover new wines) - but when it comes to the promotional emails it's just entirely too much. I'm getting several a day. I don't really want to unsubscribe - I've found a couple good wine buys via the emails - but I'm still very close to unsubscribing. The deals I can find in those emails just aren't worth being bombarded with so much spam. Really wish you guys could either better market them to your subscribers or curtail the number of emails - deleting multiple emails from one vendor/app in one day is unacceptable.

When Vivino sent me a satisfaction study on that purchase, I left a very detailed summary of the mistakes which were made.

However, the wine didn‚Äôt come before Christmas and when it did come it wasn‚Äôt the wine I had purchased. There was no note to explain the change. I gave them plenty of time to ship it before Christmas and made attempts to find out why it hadn‚Äôt arrived.

I attempted to change my delivery date and was promised that they would, but it was never changed, delivery was attempted, no one was there to sign, and I needed to pay a fee to UPS to change the date to another one. After that vivino did offer me a discount on my next order which I promptly used. I communicated that they really need a better system for contacting customer service besides emailing support which is cumbersome and time consuming.
vivino	US	VALUABLE WINE INFO	04 March 2019	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	VALUABLE WINE INFO - I do not buy wine unless I've run it through the Vivino app. It provides valuable information about all aspects of a particular wine I'm considering - cost, elements of taste and reviews.

vivino	US	Overall experience is very good	04 March 2019	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	"Overall experience is very good.  I have bought a lot of wine from these guys.  You have to pay close attention to their wine ratings though because sometimes they tout one vintage with a fabulous rating and then sell you a different one. It's a little bit of ""bait and switch"" so be careful. Also unless the ratings are by a known expert such as Robert Parker or James Suckling I don't put much faith in them as their sommelier experts always rate the wines too high.  I pay more attention to the customer reviews.  Again make sure any reviews are on the same vintage you are purchasing."
vivino	US	This is the best mobile wine app there is	04 March 2019	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	This is a great utility for wine drinkers, gifters or enthusiasts. It has a huge number of participants, both experts and casual wine lovers. The visual identification of bottles from my photos is quick and almost 100%, even the very rare and tiny production finds. It‚Äôs a great aid for shopping, and there is lots of authoritative background information available. The only thing I don‚Äôt like is the constant email suggestions for wine purchases through the app, but these are easy to delete. They need to make their money somehow. I still give Vivino 4.5 stars!
vivino	US	Love using Vivino to help analyze wine‚Ä¶	04 March 2019	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Love using Vivino to help analyze wine before I purchase and track my drinking history.

vivino	US	Best of the bunch so far	04 March 2019	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I have been ordering from Vivino partners for the last 4 years almost exclusively after using clubs and online flash sale services for many years prior. Vivino has the best selection and service by far and their pricing is as good or better than anything else I‚Äôve used. Often better. The couple hiccups or problems have been resolved immediately and to my satisfaction. Highly recommend the app and the wine sales

vivino	US	Fun to use	04 March 2019	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	"Fun to use; Stilly need to rely on your own taste!Vivino is a fun and easy to use app to view and contribute to crowdsourced data on wine.  I use it as a guide to price reasonableness.  I expect with more information added from more contributors / tasters over time the comprehensiveness will improve.  The ratings are not really reliable since I don't consider the ""crowd"" to have reliable taste in wine ;-), but cannot really blame the app for that!My only suggestion is to increase the depth of history of older wines.  I've often been forced to go to other apps when the wine is ~2000 or older."

vivino	US	I recommend Vivino very highly to everyone	04 March 2019	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I recommend you frequently.  I appreciate the reviews and seek out information almost daily.  For ordering, things run very smoothly for a few of the vendors.  I am in Alabama and the option of shipping here is very simple as long as the shipper puts the form which I send from our DABC in the box and ship to the location designated on that form.  A few of your vendors will not ship here and perhaps some education with them might be a help.  That said I am very appreciative of Vivino!

vivino	NL	Good but with a caveat	04 March 2019	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	Used the app for years.Best feature is price comparison. .. AND avoiding lousy wines... at least I think so.Reviews are all amateur/ like mine- so not really trustworthy.  One mans wine is another mans vinegar.  And fruit forward to me might mean something completely different to you.The one thing we need is common terminology, which can only be had by engaging professionals to create reviews.A section devoted to sommelier reviews would be welcome and worth a few bucks a year.  Others we are left thrashing about, trying to sort through pretentious idiocy and well thought out reviews.I‚Äôve enjoyed buying wines on the app, but caveat,  be sure to check online prices against the app.  Sometimes the Vivino price is great!  Other times you can get the wine 10 to as much as 25% less.   But as far as ease of use and finding good bargains, this is an excellent app.
vivino	US	Terrible customer service support experience	04 March 2019	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	Unsatisfactory customer support. There is only messaging and email available for customer support. No phone number available. Slow to respond and when response is received it did not address the issue.
vivino	US	Very convenient app	04 March 2019	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Very convenient app.  It saves time and money.  If I find a wine I like at a restaurant, I often order a case before the meal is finished.  In this way, I have already tasted the wine and never order something on a hunch.  I also get the best-offered price.

vivino	US	A frequent user	04 March 2019	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I use Vivino app almost daily, to memorialize the wines we have tried or to make an informed decision before purchasing a new wine.  I add new wines to the Vivino data base that have not been scanned before as well as occasionally offering edits regarding the grape varieties in blended wines that are incomplete.  I like that users have input which adds to the richness of information available.  We also purchase wine from Vivino from time to time with good results.  I recommend adding a $6 ice packet to any order so the wine is shipped in an cool insulated case, protecting it during transit.  I am looking forward to Vivino offering a premium membership again that would make it more cost effective to try new varietals and wineries.

Recently I was ready to purchase wine offered via the vivino.com website, had it in the basket with a good price and shipping costs, but the significant disclaimers that came up during the order process (possession is mine at the time / location of shipment, I needed to know whether the import of this wine into Virginia was allowed and no indication that the wine shipment was insured for damage) pushed me to delete the order.  I have a case of wine coming in from another web broker where they cover any physical damage to the bottles, the bottles are packed in insulated containers with good quality ice packs.  I need similar assurances from vivino.com for me to order wine via the website.

vivino	US	Less Mkt hype vs better information	04 March 2019	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	Less Mkt hype vs better info on the wine would give them more street cred. Ratings need to be more accurate regarding specific year vs o/a vineyard rating. Unacceptable is having one rating on listing and a different one when visiting the actual offer info. Their prices aren‚Äôt always lowest so again lose credibility (Example Voyage 6 $49 vs $25 that I paid).  Great web site to get wine feedback using photos. Also like having access to price info on my favorite wines while also comparing their ratings to mine. Limits my vulnerability. So don‚Äôt hype a 3.9 /4.0 bottle listing for $40 when you are selling 4.3s for $25!

Never saw a wine on vivino that the writers didn't make it sound that it was the best wine that that tasted in a year.  Just for once say that the wine is mediocre BUT it is 70% cheaper than you can buy in the store.  Sometimes they have good deals on wines with good wine at a cheaper price than you can buy in the store. Unfortunately you cant use Vivino as a standalone app.  You need to verify with other apps.

They once substituted a vintage even though I checked the box indicatng not to and most recently they sent 750ml bottles instead of the 1L bottles offered in the daily email.  The latter issue got fixed and they offered a discount off my next order for the former, but it was still a hassle and it doesn't inspire confidence to order again when they have screwed up 50% of the first four orders I ever made.

vivino	US	Avoid ordering wine through Vivino - misleading!	04 March 2019	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	"I ordered an exclusive wine through Vivino and was surprised and disappointed to see that I was sold another year vintage instead of the year I was ordering. The retailer charged me the 2015 vintage but delivered a 2014 vintage - big difference in wine making! I was further dismayed when Vivino did nothing to resolve the matter. They claimed that another vintage year is allowed but there was no proof of my signature or approval when I ordered it online.  I believe Vivino's ""selling"" service is extremely misleading.  I like their rating system, information about wine but when it comes to ordering through their recommended vendors, they do not stand behind their recommendation with 3rd party resellers who mislead and under-deliver to consumers."

All of the info, features, in-app recommendations and wine reviews are by far more valuable than any fee paid for wine club prices.
vivino	US	General Review of Vivino	04 March 2019	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	Customer service slow to respond. I had a corked bottle of wine which took a few emails to get replaced. I then had a second bottle from the same order which was corked but given the time and effort it took to get the first bottle replaced I didn‚Äôt bother with the second. Shipping is also a little slower than a comparable wine company I use. Although so far I have not experienced the shipping problems some people have complained about.

vivino	US	Clear Shiiping Instructions	04 March 2019	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	You should make it VERY clear in the shipping instructions that the wine must be signed for when delivered.  A screen should open prior to hitting ‚Äúorder‚Äù confirm this.  We spent two weeks an an additional $12 to chase down the wine and have it redirected to a different address.  We work so we‚Äôre not at home waiting for deliveries.  That was pretty frustrating.

vivino	US	Change the rating system	04 March 2019	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	The only thing I wish Vivino would address is giving the option to rate wines to the tenth of a point (4.1, 4.3, 4.7, etc,).

vivino	US	I requested	04 March 2019	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	I requested, via email, that a case of wine be shipped to a FedEx store (address provided) in my town. I was assured this was not a problem. Well, the wine was shipped via UPS and of course refused by the FedEx store. Plus, the response time to my email to correct the mistake took a couple of days and the responses were not material to the problem. All very odd. And lastly there is no way, or at least I couldn't figure it out, to call someone to solve the problem.  Customer service came up short in my estimation. I never received the wine. A credit was finally issued.

vivino	US	Expert Sommelier Ratings???	04 March 2019	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Not sure who you are using as your expert sommelier but please start providing more realistic ratings that are more in line with the rest of the rating industry, everything can't be 95-100 rating, particularly at your price points.  When your sommelier rating departs so far from community reviews, it's obvious there is a problem.

I ordered 16 bottles of wine for the holiday's when we were hosting.  I chased, left messages, and only received notes saying ""we are checking with the vendor"" or ""we aren't responsible for shipping"".  Then the insult of an offer to cancel the order with a $100 penalty and 20% restocking fee.  The bottles showed up finally, in January!"
vivino	US	It‚Äôs a revolutionary app	04 March 2019	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	It‚Äôs a revolutionary app, I trust the crowd source more than expert reviews. The only thing that could make this a home run would be letting me know what wines are available locally. I‚Äôm not a case buyer and very often ordering by mail is too costly
vivino	US	Highly recommended	04 March 2019	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	As with anything, you need to do your homework.  Not all Vivino offerings are spectacular deals.  I often compare when I can to big box store prices and I do find several very good Vivino deals.  The wine has always lived up to its billing, the shipping has been timely and flawless and the sheer number of offerings are incredible.  A day doesn't go by that I don't get an email with the next opportunity.Do due diligence, but buy with confidence that you are getting a quality product at a very reasonable if not exceptional price.

I will say, though, that I don't use it nearly as much without the Premium feature. It was much more enticing to read about a wine and then buy a couple bottles. But with the minimum bottle purchases going way up without free shipping, it's a totally different experience. Still like the app but my review probably moves from a 5-star to a 3-star.

I order my wines on the fly (several at a time) and don't always remember to change the default.2) I like to order throughout the week adding items to my cart and when I have enough to avoid shipping charges I pull the trigger.  However, my shopping cart gets erased after a certain amount of time (I dunno how much) and I don't remember all the deals that I previously selected - so Vivino & I both lose an order3)Customer service does not address these issues even though I have contacted them.To date in 2019, I have purchase about 5 cases of wine from VivinoThanksKerry Jablonski562-233-7912"

The only complaint I have is an issue with the website.  So, for example, you have the featured wine...than a listing of other suggested wines. So, say I select several from that list, but I may have others in another ""cart"" that I'd like to include in that order...well that can't be done (you cannot combine items from one cart to another).  So, that means I have to have two separate orders which doesn't work well and I'd end up incurring shipping fees.  Other than that, its fine."

vivino	US	Not necessarily a great price	04 March 2019	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	While some of their offerings may indeed be a ‚Äúbargain‚Äù, many of their presentations have severely inflated strike-through pricing and a lot of hyperbole. It‚Äôs gotten a lot more difficult to figure out if it‚Äôs a genuine deal. Caveat emptor. Many times i‚Äôm able to find a lower price. Too much work.

The only cons I have about the app is the removing from your cellar once you are drinking the wine and how that is reported. There seems to be some issues with the comments that I try to leave. Sometimes they‚Äôre visible and sometimes not. No way to tell what are internal notes for when I want to buy again and what goes out to the rest of the Vinvino users.

For those of us who enjoy wine but do not have the time or expertise to weed out the good from bad, Vivino offers a solution. Use the Vivino app.  Take a picture of the bottle using the app.  The app instantly recognizes and provides ratings and costs for just about every bottle I have tried.  You don't need to be an expert when you have Vivino with you. I am also delighted by the occasional sales the Vivono sends to you.  The prices are usually out of sight. It's a great service.
vivino	US	Good, Bad, Ugly- they got all.	04 March 2019	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	Most wines are good but there have been instances of horrible wines offered as a special deal. Some of them worthy of trashing. It has caused me to pull back a bit from trusting the special deals. I would opt for buying those which I already know and have tried out. Delivery options can be controlled with a preferred day of delivery as it becomes challenging when some wines delivery takes longer and it is not possible for someone to be at home to receive wines. In my opinion the delivery options is the biggest challenge, more so in summer as the wines get spoiled if one is not able to receive and the transporter takes it back and stores in uncontrolled temps.

vivino	US	Pathetic	04 March 2019	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	"My first and only order from Vivino arrived with spoiled wine.  I immediately wrote back to the company using the only customer service platform available - an email address.  I provided an explanation of what happened as well as a picture.  No reply.  After a week passed, I wrote again.  Still no reply.  Now more than a month has passed and still Vivino has 100% ignored me.   How crazy is it that the company is asking for feedback relating to its customer service when it offers absolutely none?  Vivino goes out of the way to ensure there is no means to contact anyone in the company except via email, and then conveniently ignores its inbox.  How pathetic.  Wish you had a zero stars option, because that would be far more accurate.  And I'm not seeking anonymity.  My name is Vic Bernson and I'll gladly speak to anyone from Vivino who might deign to review the ""customer service"" inbox to find my messages and respond to me."

All other wine stores on the net have live customer service.  Getting through my issue took way too long and was too cumbersome.Last, Vivino keeps advertising 95 and 98 point wines.  Problem is the rating are from no name wine experts.  Need to have more really good priced wines with rating from Robert parker, Wine Spector, etc.
vivino	US	Good....when things are good	04 March 2019	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	"I was pleased with Vivino (and had filled my 150 bottle cellar) until I purchased a wine on a Tuesday for $42 / btl on an offer, then got another offer for the same wine for $39.99 2 days later (before my wine had even shipped!).  I voiced my displeasure with Vivino customer service and traded notes with them, but got some mumbo jumbo re: their procedures and ""rounding"" and ultimately was not provided an adjustment.  They lost credibility (and my business).Some good wines and values, but when issues arise (pricing in my case, reimbursement for damaged wine in my friend's case), customer service is lacking."

vivino	US	Vintage Swap without Your Consent	25 February 2019	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	"Vintage Swap without Your ConsentSo I went to buy a wine from Vivino.  On their site it said inventory was available but when the order finally sent me a confirmation, they placed it for a different vintage.  I complained to support because you cannot cancel online.  Two days later I received this""I reviewed your order details and see that ""Closest Vintage Substituion Allowed"" was selected for this particular order. In this case, our fulfillment partner will send the next available vintage if they sell out of the vintage originally ordered.""Well I did not click anything or give my consent which means Vivino did it for me.  That is not consent and in some States it is borderline illegal.  Even though I repeatedly asked them to cancel the order they still have not done so.""Would you like me to inquire with our partner merchant of their returns/refunds policy or would you like to keep the wine you received at a discount?""This company is a scam.Well I just got an email that this is being sent out so apparently Vivino could not ""do"" anything to stop the order.  Mind you I sent them a request 3 days ago.  The support rep has conveniently stopped replying."
vivino	US	Buyer Beware	24 February 2019	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Buyer Beware.  The company sends out snazzy marketing with links highlighting discounts.  When you click they direct to full priced bottles.  These guys are all about shady marketing.  I have seen this multiple times now to realize it is not a mistake but intentional.  These guys are scammers plain and simple.  The example on this page is true.  I also nearly bought that wine until I realized they were not 1 Liter bottles but 750ml.  Vivino does not highlight that a deal has ended.  It just sends you to something else.
vivino	US	Vivino mis advertisement	23 February 2019	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I ordered 3 1 litre  bottles of Caymus for $75 per bottle. (As advertised on their web site) They sent me 3- 750 ml bottles instead. I contacted them to find out why they did not send me what I ordered, and they said I just missed out on that deal. Did not notify me or give me a choice to cancel the ordered. I could of bought the wine at Total Wines for less. Watch out Scam!!!

No phone number and I got an automated reply to my email saying they have an unusual high number of customer service emails (no surprise).  I have not paid my cc bill so If I do not hear back soon I am reported them as fraudulent and filing with my cc company.  Wish I checked reviews first  My order is XID2F9KMaureen PI just wanted to update this review.  After I emailed the company that I was going to report them fraudulent and ask my credit card to cancel payment....I received a phone call from Vivino Customer Service.  It was not a recognized number so let it go to voicemail.  The representative was very apologetic.  She sent me an email as well stating that they were sorry that my order had seemed to ""fall through the cracks"".  She said she was expediting the order.  She also offered to refund my shipping cost and offer a discount on a future order.  I did receive shipping email with tracking.  She did follow up 2x with email to which I responded.  She said they are opening a phone customer service line.  I received the wine order today and it is correct.  I have not checked to see if my shipping cost was credited but I am sure it will be.  So bottom line.... I think they do have a fulfillment issue but they are working hard at Vivino customer service to improve this.  I am just happy I was ""heard"" and my order has arrived."

vivino	US	I bought and paid for 6 bottles of‚Ä¶	15 February 2019	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I bought and paid for 6 bottles of wine. Order #X@PKHGDU. I received 3 bottles. When I asked where the other 3 were I was told the wine had been discontinued and there would be a refund made. That never happened. All I have for my efforts to get my refund is a pile of emails from robots saying my request for a refund is in some mysterious queue. After reading some of these reviews I wonder if I will ever get my refund.James Vorhes
vivino	US	Terrible customer service	13 February 2019	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I checked on my order and when tracked, it stated that the order was delivered.  The order was not delivered or if it was delivered, it wasn‚Äôt delivered to my shipping address.  After 5 emails back and forth with Nobu @ Vivino customer service, I‚Äôm filing a complaint with my credit card in which I charged the order.  Further, I tried finding a phone number to call online and there is nothing to be found.
vivino	US	Can I possibly give Vivino no stars	13 February 2019	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Can I possibly give Vivino no stars?  This was one of the worst experiences I've ever had with a company.  It would take me way too long to tell the story.  Just know that their customer service emails do not seem to reach people who can actually read.  Their delay in responding was unacceptable.  The phone service person I finally talked to listened to nothing I said.  I was lead down a painful path with the end result being that the wine I ordered never got to me and while I was waiting for that wine wanted, it sold out just about everywhere.  I finally sourced the last two bottles directly from a vendor.  Don't use this company.
vivino	CA	Vivino customer service is NEGLIGENT & ABSENT!	31 January 2019	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	It would seem that Vivino has been reduced to using Trustpilot as their customer service portal...  Just look at the reviews here. Who is in charge over there?  I placed an order 31 days ago for $350 and have not heard a thing despite multiple attempts at reaching out to you for help (email, twitter DM, and I even tried to contact your partner company). The irony here is that your website states that you endeavour to respond within 24 hours.  Have a look for yourself: ca.shops.vivino .com/faq--Q: How can I contact Vivino?                                            A: For customer service inquiries please email ca.orders @vivino.com OR respond directly to your Order Confirmation email.DONE & DONE... nothing.Q: Do you respond quickly?A: Yes. Vivino has a dedicated Customer Service Team that will get back to you as soon as possible, typically within 24 hours.--Well it's been 744 hours and I have not heard a thing despite multiple attempts. Obviously I will have to call the credit card company to complain and get a refund from your totally disorganized 'online business'.  Why would you even offer this service if you are unable to manage it? PS - don't think we don't notice the sudden surge of positive reviews pushing down the multiple 1/5s you've been receiving from upset customers like me. All one as to do is look at this month alone.
vivino	CA	Questionable ethics:	29 January 2019	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	Questionable ethics:  Although I have had good service on multiple orders I consider it a scam when I place an order Jan 2nd and to this date have still not received it, now Jan 29th...!. Apparently it was held at customs however my credit card was charged the moment I placed the order. The order for something they didn't even have. This is technically fraud as under simple contract law both offer and acceptance is required hence a simple contract. They advertised, I paid, no product....!!! I have suggested they operate like Amazon and do not charge the customer until the product is shipped. Hence only 2 stars from me as I do not see any changes yet.
vivino	BR	Great App	28 January 2019	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Great App. Interesting ranking model and share tastings.
vivino	GB	Excellent App, shop and customer service	28 January 2019	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I have used the Vivino app for many years and love it. A great way to record the wines you are drinking, or to make better informed choices before you buy a wine.Now they have the shop we buy most of our wine from Vivino.  The offers are good and genuine discounts over most retailers. The ability to buy just one bottle of each wine is also a massive benefit if you love to try news wines as we do! Delivery is always quick and we have never had a problem. The only issue I have ever has was recently when they had less stock than I had ordered. However, the way it was dealt with was exemplary with a swift and positive resolution.I highly recommend Vivino.
vivino	CA	Amazing app to record your wine tasting notes	27 January 2019	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	We have been using Vivino for almost 3 years now and we have been exclusively using to scan and record our wine tasting notes.  We‚Äôve tried other apps and Vivino can‚Äôt be beat in this regard.  Vivino has been an invaluable tool at restaurants being able to scan the wine list and ensure we make a good purchase. As an added bonus, Vivino has a great online community of like minded people and we have now developed some lifelong global friendships.  We honestly can‚Äôt speak highly enough in this regard.As for purchasing wine, we haven‚Äôt used Vivino in this regard.
vivino	US	I have used Vivino for a couple years‚Ä¶	27 January 2019	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	I have used Vivino for a couple years and for the most part have had good luck with the wines and service. Orders have been shipped promptly and arrive as expected.  I had one order shipped that froze during shipment (I live in ND) and they issued a refund for the wine.  It did take several emails to get it resolved but it is done and I am happy with it. Customer service was polite and knowledgeable. You do need to know your wines (price, vintage, etc) so you know if this is a good deal or not. I usually buy wines I know, but take chances on others as they are reasonably priced. To date, I am pretty happy with other wines I have purchased. Reasons I gave a 4 instead of a 5 is that I live in ND and there is no way I can get wines in the winter as it is freezing temps up here and it will freeze. Also, the turn around time for email to customer service is about half a day, and if I have to respond, it is another half a day, so one email takes a full day. I believe a lot of the negative reviews could be solved with quicker response from customer support. In summary, it is a good place to get good wines at a bargain price and to me this outweighs any of the other concerns I have.
vivino	PT	Great Italian offers	27 January 2019	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	There are plenty of wines on offer and particularly Italian which I love .Just about to try Uno Primitivo..Too many emails though!

vivino	PL	App is great, however	26 January 2019	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	App is great. Useful as a notebook and quick reference. However, one star less for peculiar wine styles like Mexican Nebbiolo and no Tokay Aszu or other classics. What is more, another star less for customer support and their sterile sympathy and corporate language. Full undestanding, but no conclusions.

vivino	US	Excellent Wines...Lousy Shipping	26 January 2019	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	The wines and wine reviews are excellent.  I've ordered five different wines from Vivino and all five have been true to their descriptions and ratings.  But the problem is in the shipping of those wines.I ordered four wines with one order.  But they each dribbled in at different times.  Which meant I had to stay home four different days to sign for the wines I ordered with one order.  Vivino...we have more important things to do other than stick around the house to sign for your wines.  Get it together...literally; one order, one delivery.PS:  Sorry Vivino I don't have the order number any more.
vivino	US	Excellent Customer Service! Highly recommended!	26 January 2019	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Had an issue, my own fault, and customer service was fabulous!

vivino	US	Excellent App and Customer Service, Great Choice of Wines...	26 January 2019	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	The app is excellent and the choice of wines huge. Customer support is very good too.My only quibble is that they are not working with the suppliers/shippers to find more environmentally friendly ways of packing the bottles. Perhaps that will come‚ÄîI hope so.Anyway, give it a go. Very unlikely you'll be disappointed.
vivino	US	Great service	26 January 2019	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Great service. My order arrived way before the estimated delivery time. Also I had placed a duplicate order by error. As soon as I informed them about it they corrected it right away, credited me back and sent me a confirmation instantly.

vivino	PT	Support team	25 January 2019	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	I had several tickets about funcionality and some bugs. The support team responded quickly almost every time and for several times they managed to solve the bug quickly. About funcionality, when they didn't change anything in the app, they manage to clarify and argument about they conclusion / decision. Always nice and attentive.
vivino	US	Great ordering experience	25 January 2019	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Great ordering experience, can‚Äôt say enough about the customer service and ability to find a wine if a particular seller is out of stock.  Not sure why anyone would rate this less than 4 stars; I order a lot of wine online and I think Vivino really has done a great job.
vivino	US	This order was a 5 star experience.....	25 January 2019	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	This order was a 5 star experience, thank you!  I am renewed in my confidence of you as a means to get top tier wine at a lower price. For those nay sayers.....my first experience was not good.  I contacted them and they responded promptly, however it still took way too long for the wine to get here.  I am not sure exactly why but I gave them a second chance because I know that as a new customer, I may present some challenges.  My second order was flawless!!!  Give them a chance!
vivino	US	I accidentally had an order shipped to‚Ä¶	25 January 2019	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	I accidentally had an order shipped to an old address due to my mistake.  When I emailed Vivino to change the address, they were quick to respond and make the change while in transit.  I had to follow up with a second call to remind them to make the change after they didn't make the necessary change.  Every order that I have received from them has been accurate and timely for the most part.  I get some of them being late as they work with independent purveyors around the country as partners.  It seems as they grow they will weed out the shady liquor store owners that may be scamming
vivino	US	Somehow I wound up with TWO Vivino‚Ä¶	25 January 2019	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Somehow I wound up with TWO Vivino accounts, which I only learned after a helpful Vivino customer service rep explained that to me, when I saw only 13 wines in my feed (I knew I'd entered hundreds). They helpfully merged the two accounts and were so professional and timely. Super helpful in an age where it's hard to get any help on social media apps.
vivino	US	The worst service still waiting for‚Ä¶never use jvivino	24 January 2019	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	The worst service still waiting for info on my order after a week
vivino	US	Unacceptable refund process	22 January 2019	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	I have had good wine at a good price from Vivino, but my last order, they described the wine as magnum when it was not.  Asked if I wanted to cancel, which I did.  They charged my credit card on December 24, 2018.  I cancelled the order due to their error on Jan 4, 2019 as soon as I was informed.   They indicated they have submitted a request for refund, but it has not been processed almost 3 weeks later.  I will have to contest charge with credit card company.  Not acceptable for a reputable company
vivino	US	Ordered 4 bottles on January 11th	21 January 2019	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Ordered 4 bottles on January 11th. The order tracking indicates the order was shipped but the company cannot provide any evidence of a shipment. Is this company a scam?

The wine was delivered but it was a lower end wine from the same winery worth around $40.  I sent an email to vivino immediately informed them of the incorrect wine and they responded back rather quickly asking for photos.  They said once they received the photos they would send me a return label and they would send me the correct bottles.  That was nearly 2 weeks ago and I haven't heard back from them since.  I've tried emailing again, twitter, facebook... nothing.  I've ordered wine from vivino before without issues but this was the first time the wrong wine was delivered.  I'm very disappointed.

vivino	US	I feel like I was scammed	02 January 2019	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I feel like I was scammed. 1) I thought I was buying (3) 2012 vintage wines 2) I paid for the value of those 2012 wines 3) I received (3) 2016 vintage wines instead.  How do you falsely advertise the 2012 when you don't have suppliers that carry it? And then charge someone the higher price vs the cost of the 2016. On top of that, you can't even get a hold of anyone in support. It's like a blackhole.
vivino	US	Just horrible.	25 December 2018	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	NEVER order from them. My Christmas wine was not delivered though UPS said I accepted delivery - at least that is what Vivino told me after a long wait, and that they were investigating. That was the last I heard from them, many attempts on my part, and no wine. They are taking no responsibility and never even sent the UPS tracking information. Final result: Vivino cancelled the charge after reading this review and being notified by the credit card company that the charge was in dispute. This took weeks! They were so sorry, offering me 10% off the next order which I laughed off. Then they went to 20%...lol, they just don't get it. Blaming growth for their problems - no customer service, no way to call them. Stay away.
vivino	US	Great app but horrible service	25 December 2018	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Ordered 6 bottles of wine on December 10th, hoping to have them for a Christmas dinner we were hosting. Did not receive the shipment notice as expected within 2 days. I gave them couple of more days and finally reached out via app. Received an automated response saying the order is still processing and will notify me when they are ready to ship. I give them another few days but no response from the app. I called AMEX to dispute the charges for fraudulent service and they gave me full refund after investigation. They will flag the merchant.

vivino	US	VIVINO IS A SCAM SERVICE	14 December 2018	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	"VIVINO IS A SCAM SERVICE - DO NOT BUY FROM THEM. They bait and switch. I regrettably purchased 2014 Silver Oak, Napa Valley at $94.99/bottle (6 in total) and their wine merchant, SCAMMER TOO (Thompson Wines in NYC) sent me 2014 Silver Oak, Alexander Valley, which VIVINO advertises on their website at $67.99/bottle. I have spoken to wine merchant rep ""Billy"" who told me to contact VIVINO. A complete waste of (2) e-mails and messages on their CONTACT US page. I tried their HQ office number 650-387-1566 but no one picks up. I have put in a dispute with AMEX and will eventually contact NYS AG office to file a complaint for fraud/collusion with Thompson Wines of NYC if I do not get a full refund. COMPLETE NONESENSE!!!!"
vivino	US	Horrible service!	08 December 2018	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	They have a great app to review wine, but please do NOT buy through the app. We have emailed customer service 6 times in 3 days with one automated response. Beyond a joke!Buy on the wine dot com app, or take a drive to your nearest store. Just not worth the headache.
vivino	US	Horrible Customer Service	06 December 2018	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	"Tony Brake  doesn't recommend Vivino.39 mins ¬∑ Just an absolutely HORRIBLE experience with my latest order. Two bottles of the six I ordered (to get free shipping) were dropped from my order without my being given the opportunity to either make a substitution or cancel my order, and the amount refunded, which I STILL am awaiting an explanation for, suggests they hit me with shipping charges. Customer ""service"" is effectively worthless. I contacted them over a week ago with these issues, and they still have not responded. Don't waste your time or money ordering from this company! They certainly won't receive another order from me."
vivino	US	Incorrect wine sent vivino doesn't seem to care	04 December 2018	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I placed an order for a mixed case of wine and received a different wine in place of a few of the $30 bottles of wine.  All I want is a partial refund for the mistake and I am being told to personally pay forto return the incorrect wine that was sent to me.  This was not my fault but Vivino doesn't seem to care.  After saying this is unacceptable I asked to speak with someone on a phone or a different rep and they have been ignoring me.  I reach out multiple times a week and by app and nobody will contact me.  I would not place an order with Vivino again.

vivino	US	INCOMPLETE ORDER	19 November 2018	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	I have contacted Vivino via email since there is no phone contact number.  I have received only 11 out of the 23 bottles I ordered.  I have ordered from Vivino before, and not had problems.  This is not acceptable.I have now been contacted by someone from Vivino saying the rest of my order is shipping.  Hopefully the order arrives by Wednesday, November 21.I am not holding my breath.
vivino	US	Bait and Switch	16 November 2018	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	The first time I ordered from Vivino I encountered similar problems to other reviewers...my order was processed but I never received any confirmation or shipping information and it took several weeks of follow-up to finally get my order delivered. I did, however, continue to use Vivino without further incident until my last order. I ordered 6 bottles of wine ($29.99 per bottle). They shipped me the wrong wine. After several days of back and forth with Vivino, the customer rep informed my that their merchant partners will substitute wines if they no longer have something in stock. However, the wine they shipped was a $18.50 bottle of wine. How is that a substitute?  There was no communication with me regarding a change (i would have cancelled the order) . There was no attempt to acknowledge or account for the difference in price (isn't that fraud?) and now I'm responsible for getting the wine returned in order to get my refund (which is going to be a whole another issue I can tell).  Absolutely ridiculous. Buyer beware, these folks cannot be trusted!

vivino	US	Great experience so far.	02 November 2018	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	So far I don‚Äôt understand all the terrible reviews. I think the iPhone app is awesome, and ordering is super easy. So far I have placed 3 orders using the app with 2 different merchants and they have arrived perfect and on time. If you sign up for the UPS app my choice, you will get notifications of all your packages even before your retailer notifies you so that is a good work around for all those wanting super fast shipping notices. From the UPS app you can even specify a date for you to be home for the package. Vivino has impressed me so far and I‚Äôm a fan!
vivino	US	Vivino is just a shell	28 October 2018	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Vivino is just a shell. It is like an ad site for the merchants that sign up with it.  It has no control over the merchants so if you find a wine you want to buy, check out the individual merchant. DO NOT RELY ON ANYTHING FROM VIVINO IS YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH A MERCHANT. One to stay far away from is La Vinotheque.  See my review of that merchant on this site.  Also and this is important, THE RATINGS NEXT TO THE WINE IS AN AVERAGE OF MULTIPLE VINTAGES NOT THE RATING OF THE PARTICULAR WINE.  IF YOU WANT OBJECTIVE RATINGS TRY WINE ENTHUSIAST (WINEMAG.COM) CELLAR TRACKER OR WINE SEARCHER
vivino	US	I'm done	26 October 2018	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Life is too short.  They screwed up my shipping address, don't respond to emails, can't be reached by phone, and I can't login despite trying everything to retrieve password, etc....so I'm done.  Can't order anyway.  What a crock.
vivino	PE	I finally decided to place an order‚Ä¶	26 October 2018	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I finally decided to place an order through Vivino. What a mistake. They charged my credit card immediately and I received a notification that I would receive a delivery confirmation within 3-5 business days. After a couple weeks I decided to follow-up with Vivino. Two weeks later and multiple emails with no responses led me to write a negative response. The customer service is horrendous. There is no phone number to call, only email, which no one responds. It's unfortunate because the app and deals are fabulous.

Little did i know that their shipping service was UPS and that FedEx would not accept it.It would have been nice if this was indicated somewhere on the website.The package was refused and returned to sender.On Oct. 3rd, I provided a new address to June Vic L (who i was then communicating with), in order to re-send my package.On Oct. 12, June wrote the following: ""Momentarily i will be sending you the tracking information so you can monitor the progress of the shipment and delivery yourself"".But a week later and I still haven't heard anything regarding the shipment of my order, and I am becoming quite concerned. Can't even reach anyone by phone to discuss this problem. Now getting ready to cancel the order and try getting my money back."
vivino	US	terrible customer support, full of lies	16 October 2018	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	So, since my last post(items was late, wrong, cheaper than I ordered and vivino asked me accountable for return cost), I was contacted by a customer support lead who claim will resolve the situation. On the phone, she promised to resolve it by end of last Friday and after that, it's just silence... no action, no updates, nothing... This is the last email I received from vivino customer support 5 days ago:I did speak with our merchant partner who is completely fine with you sending the wine back for a refund :) I am working with them now to set this up and to make sure you will not be held accountable for any of the fees associated with sending the wines back.Once the merchant partner gets back to me of what we need to do, I will let you know!Cheers,Jackie US Customer Experience Team LeadHonestly, I am so fed up with them, they did every wrong thing and blaming you(customer) for placing order on their app. So as a normal person I give up and will not recommend any normal person to order anything from vivino...
vivino	ID	Bought a bottle of wine and tried to‚Ä¶	12 October 2018	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	Bought a bottle of wine and tried to chase for confirmation but still no reply after 1 business day, even that my CC has been charged. The infrastructure is lacking to support ecommerce. Guess this will be my last purchase.UPDATE: Received the good several days after contacted the supplier directly and the order was confirmed to be shipped (after the weekend). Product was correct and packed safely with Fragile sign. I think I will purchase directly from supplier/merchant website (helped by Google Translate) as the platform is still lacking to support smooth ecommerce experience. It is a good place to learn about wine before buying for amateurs like me though. Added 2 stars from 1.
vivino	US	Too much hype in their wine reviews	09 October 2018	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	"I ordered six bottles of ""100 point"" wine from Vivino. Certainly, I didn't expect this rating to be on par with Wine Enthusiast or a well known wine expert. What I did expect was a wine worth at least what I paid. The wine I bought is just average, and what I'd expect to get for about 20% less than what I paid. I figured I'd give Vivino a try, so that's my one and done. I might buy from them again if I see a wine from a winery I know and the price is right.Regarding the ordering process, it appears they only inform you of your transaction when it ships. I sent an email inquiring about my order, as there's no way to see your order status on their website. I did receive a prompt and courteous response to my inquiry, which came the same day my wine shipped."
vivino	GB	Vivino sent me the wrong wine	09 October 2018	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Vivino sent me the wrong wine. The wine Vivino sent me is a cheaper wine that what I paid for. I've sent an email 4 days ago asking for the incorrect wine to be collected and still no reply.  Totally unimpressed and feel ripped off.
vivino	US	Two orders. 50% Success. Almost!	08 October 2018	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	First order of 3 expensive wines arrived in a cheap, styrofoam/cardboard package. Wines rattling around. Very poor for such a price.Second order: Order confirmed, money taken out on credit card but no order shipment details, no record of order in ‚Äúmy orders‚Äù and no phone number to call customer service.No reply by email as yet.Terrible way to do business. Will think long and hard before ordering again.If ever...
vivino	US	Bad customer service	28 September 2018	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Bad customer service, delivery issues, delivery company is complicated to work with or doesn't deliver. Stay away.
vivino	US	Poor shipping and handling	27 September 2018	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I ordered some wine from Vivino and the first order arrive after two weeks with a proper cold pack. I just received two additional orders today that came from Napa Cellars out of CA with now cool pack and where on the road according to my shipping confirmation for 10 days. I spend 800 $ for these wines and don‚Äôt know if they are still good. Tried to contact Vivino trough my app but there is no button or CS link. I still waiting for two orders, but Most likely will not order any high end wine again from them as I can not trust 1st class service. Regather spend 10% more but quality will be good. After all life is to short to drink bad wine
vivino	CA	Have ordered twice got product on time‚Ä¶	26 September 2018	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Have ordered twice got product on time my concern is their ratings. I am purchasing wine that are not up to par with wines I am purchasing in that price category.
vivino	CA	Don't Order Wine From Vivino	24 September 2018	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Vivino was recommended by a friend.  I ordered several bottles of wine.  I received a message by way of their mobile app that the items had been shipped.  However, I never received a shipping notification via e-mail, so I contacted them.  I received a standard, stock email response that the items could be shipped the next day, but no later than Friday.  Friday passed without the items shipping.  At this point I sensed something nefarious was going on so I requested my orders to be cancelled.  I received partial credit for my purchase not because I requested the orders to be cancelled, but because one of the wines was no longer in stock.  I re-messaged, e-mailed them requesting my orders to all be cancelled and the purchase moneys be credited back to my credit card. That was over a week ago and no response.  I am extremely disappointed in the service and will never use them again.  It seems this is not an isolated event by reading other reviews.  I wish I had read Trustpilot before I had placed my order.
vivino	US	Shipping error and Poor service	17 September 2018	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	I had a bad experience of getting my wine the first time.  They said it was cause the vendor had delays.  Well then don‚Äôt put wines on your site that can‚Äôt be shipped out promptly !!  Second experience - 9/12/2018. They were supposed to update the shipping address right after I placed a $400 order.  They did not.  The wine was supposed to go to my office and be signed for.  UPS came to my house instead?!? I could not change delivery of the wines cause the shipper did not allow it.  I waited all day Saturday at home for the ups guy who In the end told me my package was not on his truck !!!! Who knows how UPS Stores their packages.  i have to go pickup the wines from the ups station now.  What a joke.  I‚Äôm done ordering from them.  They don‚Äôt have a US support number ? The responsd to emails in 24 to 48 hours ? Seriously ?!? Poor Customer service will destroy a business.  Guess you all are headed down that patch.  There deals are not that great anyway.  Buy from your local wine store.  We have plenty here in Houston that have amazing selections.
vivino	US	Shipping Error - solution: order to workplace!	11 September 2018	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	I requested FedEx delivery 2 minutes after I received my order number - AS INSTRUCTED BY VIVINO - and they didn't honor my request.  They sent the wine via UPS who requires an adult signature.  But I will be at my job.  I don't have 2 hours to go the warehouse district in downtown Los Angeles to pick up the wine at the UPS center.  I guess I'll try to have wine returned to sender and have AmEx fight the charges.EDIT: Reply to Vivino‚Äôs reply: I already emailed you at the address you suggest. Do you think you‚Äôll be able to ‚Äúfind‚Äù my second email?2nd EDIT: Wine arrived and my assistant signed for it. If you don‚Äôt have an adult (21+) who‚Äôs ready to sit around all day (in my case 2 days because of UPS ‚Äúdelay‚Äù) then SHIP WINE TO WORKPLACE. Otherwise buy from local retailer. Vivino will not ship in a convenient way.
vivino	US	I have ordered regularly from Vivino‚Ä¶Customer NO SERVICE	10 September 2018	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	I have ordered regularly from Vivino over the last 2 years and only had a problem with two bottles of wine shipped.  The last time I ordered in August 2018, I have not received my wine.  I have contacted Customer No Service three times at two different email addresses and NO response.  They must have some significant issues so I will NOT be ordering again until they somehow show their support has improved dramatically
vivino	US	In the End, Customer Service Came Through.	08 September 2018	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	Downloaded the Vivino App and within a few days received notice of a sale of a label that sounded interesting. Ordered 6 bottles shipped to Myrtle Beach and received shipment within a two week period via UPS. Wine was very warm upon unpacking with the cold pad completely dry. I immediately informed Vivino of the poor shipping. I decided to use the app on the new bottles & found the following. The app rated my wine 3.7 where the buy ad rated it 4.2. The app had a suggested price per bottle of $14.97, I paid $17.99. Requested via email from customer service an explanation (3 times) and finally received an agreeable answer: full refund. Not sure I'll ever order wine from them again but have to say that they stood behind their service. I think they are paying attention to all the negative reviews and it's making a difference. We shall see.
vivino	US	Terrible experience--bad shipping, leaking bottle!	24 August 2018	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	"My first order was canceled due to the wine being out of stock (app showed it was in stock).  Yes, that can happen.  Then my second order arrived with a leaking bottle that ruined the whole shipment.  There is no phone number to contact them for immediate support, only by email.  No way to cancel orders online, only by the same email address.11/1/2018 - Despite being offered a refund by customer service beginning of September, here I am two months later without a refund, no update.  Customer service rep claims she processed the refund back in September, and again beginning of October.  Last update a week ago, she is ""checking"" with her ""finance department""."
vivino	US	Another One Bites The Dust	23 August 2018	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	"Like many others, no wine received, credit card charged and countless e- mails sent with ZERO response.Stopped payment with American Express, will never buy from these clowns again.They have great hype about their wine ""gems"", however I have been less than impressed.  Lots of secondary labeled wine, overproduced wines that don't sell on the retail market, choose wisely...Another lost customer, get it together and get a telephone line, might help your sales."
vivino	US	Shipping wine by UPS means you don't care about your customers' time.	21 August 2018	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	"I actually like the Vivino service overall - but their customer focus is extremely lacking. My gripe is that they seem to have no control over their resellers - some of which do stupid things like ship their wine via UPS. Why is that stupid? Because UPS is the worst company to ship wine with. Adult signature is required, so unless you're going to sit at home all day, they won't leave it - not very good for those of us who have a thing called a ""job"". Fine, but UPS also won't redirect it to a local access point. Instead, you can only pick it up from a UPS distribution center which of course is far away where they have enough land to stick a distribution center. ""Let us know before hand and we'll ship it by Fedex for you"", Vivino says - well, nope... did that, got a response from customer service, and out it goes by UPS anyway. Vivino, it's the little things like this that matter. Your service is supposed to make things MORE convenient, not LESS. I'm very upset with you and your Napa Wine Cellars reseller needs to get their act together. If it weren't for your other (better) resellers, I'd be done with this service. And to Napa Wine Cellars - I'm done with you, you're banned from my purchases.EDIT -After speaking with customer service, I found that *all* shipments are now going out by UPS. Unfortunate. I'm going to try their suggestion of asking them to ship via Fedex next time I order something. Will update my review if it works because that will restore my utility for this service. UPS really needs to allow wine to be picked up at one of their access points - otherwise, they'll never be as convenient as Fedex."
vivino	US	Worst ecommerce experience I have EVER‚Ä¶	16 August 2018	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Worst ecommerce experience I have EVER had. I placed an order for six bottles of reasonably pricy wine. The 5-7 day buffer Vivino mentions about shipping came and went without a shipping notification. I messaged their customer service, which took ages to get back to me, only for someone to basically say sorry we'll look into it and let you know. Days pass and no one gets back to me. In fact, the convo via the app is closed out. It's now been over ten business days and no shipping notification. I'm fed up with Vivino. I have opened another support ticket that I imagine will take ages to get a response from to cancel my order and receive a full refund. I suspect due to the incompetence of Vivino this will have to go to a credit card dispute. If you're thinking that this is a convenient way to buy wine please stop yourself and spend your money literally anywhere else. Complete garbage experience.
vivino	US	There is no tracking # sent for‚Ä¶	09 August 2018	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	There is no tracking # sent for shipments.  I have a locked gate. Shipments are delayed and the quality of the wine is degraded due to the heat.

Each arrived intact , on time and correct.I also have 3 friends using the same service and none have experienced the negativity others here have posted. I can only say "" what can I try next !!"""
vivino	US	cancel my order and no option to terminate my subscription	30 July 2018	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I had ordered a wine under the trail premium offer, the wine was never delivered, Instead I got an email that that wine cannot be delivered to my address because of some legal issues. The customer support just asked me order it from some other seller, but didn't give me the list of sellers which will actually deliver it to my address. I don't want the hassle of ordering it again and then not getting it, so I decided to cancel the subscription, but I couldn't find the option anywhere in the app. Later I read that vivino doesn't automatically renew the premium from trial, so I didnt take any action. But they deducted the money from my card.Now knowing that I can't use their services still I have to pay that hefty price.
vivino	US	Where to begin	13 July 2018	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	Where to begin? Poor handling of wine, stryofoam case within the carboard box was cracked granted it might be the third party shipper's fault (UPS) but in the end me, the customer suffered from this. Also the corks on some of the wine is beginning to rise due to the heat. Where was the Vivino option to hold back delivery to avoid wine spoilage? With WTSO you can choose when you want your wine shipped up to one year and Wine.com has protocols in place to not ship wine out in the event of extreme heat temperatures.I also ordered 14 bottles of wine, I only got 12, that was blatant disregard to the order...how can they manage to screw that up? Emailed Vivino customer service immediately upon opening the package, still no reply.
vivino	US	Where is my wine?	11 July 2018	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	I placed an order july 2nd with the company. I have contacted them since July 8th asking where my wine is or for a tracking number. No response from the costumer service team via the  app. No idea when my wine is even supposed to arrive. It is now July 11. No response, no tracking, no idea what‚Äôs going on. This costumer service is unacceptable in this day and age. Great app, great wine reviews. Terrible place to buy wine unless they can fix these (seemingly small) details that mean a lot to a customer who shells out money online with trust. -disappointed
vivino	US	I placed an order on June 16	23 June 2018	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	I placed an order on June 16, received a confirmation of the order, as well as messaged by my credit card company that my card had been charged.  All well and good, but no tracking number, or how my order would be shipped.  I sent a message, concerned about where my order would be  shipped and wanted to clarify shipping method, to make sure I would actually receive my wine.  I'm still waiting for any kind of contact.  This may be my last order with them.  Fortunately, I can cancel the charge on my cc if I don't get my wine soon (I paid $50 extra to expedite shipping).
vivino	US	This is the worst service ever.	22 June 2018	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	"This is the worst service (or lack thereof) that I have ever received from anyone, anywhere, ever.They took my money on the 3rd, and now on the 22nd, it still hasn't arrived. When you write to them, they lie and make s**t up, and when you show them the tracking, the two morons who eventually respond,come up with answers like a kid saying "" the dog ate my homework"".  Save your money and time, these guys are the worst. I have zero confidence that whatever they deliver would be drinkable, and personally I don't believe their BS of temperature control, they aren't smart enough to manage that sort of thing.  I've asked for a week now to cancel and refund, and as yet..no reply.  I've had to contact the CC company to protest the charge."
vivino	US	Where's my wine?	19 June 2018	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Where's my wine?  The first two orders I placed with Vivino were delivered (almost) as promised.  My current, third order, placed June 2, has been making the trek from California to Louisiana in a very leisurely manner.  It apparently decided to take a pause in Madill, OK - where it has been since June 12 - how's that $6 ice pack holding up, I wonder?. FedEx is clueless; Vivino completely unresponsive.  Can't imagine that I will use Vivino again after this experience.
vivino	US	Customer service is AWOL	07 June 2018	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	Customer service is AWOL! Had been happily using them for about a year...until I required customer service. An order of six bottles of a highly rated red arrived and was initially disappointing. Nothing horrible, just not as described and quite disappointing ...so much as to make one wonder how so many would describe it as they had. The second was the same. The third however was a world apart from the first two - both my wife and I agreed it was outstanding and now fit the various descriptors in so many reviews. There was a second bottle that was also great, but it would remain 2/6 with the other 4 being just meh and tasting like a much lighter wine. All six bottles had very heavy sediment that coated the bottom of the corks and settled in even the first poured glass. I wrote to customer service, included a pic of one of the sediment covered corks, and explained our experience.  I received no response at all. After several weeks I re-sent the email wondering if I‚Äôd missed their response. Nothing at all came back from them. No explanation or apology, questions or concerns, much less an offer of replacement . We‚Äôre fortunate to have a Total Wine nearby. Prices when they have identical bottles are usually pretty close, and their customer service is outstanding. We‚Äôll be taking our business there. The app remains useful and works great, but buyer beware on purchases.
vivino	AU	BOOM!	06 June 2018	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	Epic! Finding the app extremely useful in particular the features such as star rating, price, and summary. Unless I have overlooked, I would be interested in a feature suggesting when the wine is at its perfection e.g. 5-10 years from now? Keen to store a few dozen and let it mature a bit. Keep up the good work!

Vivino doesn't provide any phone numbers to contact them for the shipment.  Now I have to contact the (ABC), Alcohol Beverage Control of NJ to see if they have a phone number to reach them.
vivino	GB	Wines not delivered	07 April 2018	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Had to take a day off work for a delivery that did not come, furthermore they had not even given it to the courier to deliver so I am not sure why they even said it had been dispatched. I was then promised delivery the next day and still did not come. Very poor service.It is so frustrating that they do not even have a phone number to call and only reply to emails so you rely entirely on them contacting you.I eventually did receive the wine and it was not the one they advertised. Now arranging to send the wine back.*** EDIT as of 17th April 2018 Vivino have said that they will process a refund and I hope this goes through

The amount of users and reviews is making vivino an indispensable tool for wine purchases. I trust Vivino's rating more than I trust WA or WE. However... :)In terms of features, user experience, sharing capabilities and many other aspects, you guys are way too far behind. Examples:1. Your website. It's obvious that you've totally neglected it. It's disgraceful.2. Your android app does not support split screen.3. You've created a social media channel, but users can only comment on reviews with text. No way to upload photos/clips on these threads.4. No way to see what my friends liked or commented on.5. No way to control the feed... i want to exclude white wines from my feed..6. Personal notes are clumsy and an overall bad UXI'd love to see you take this app to the next level. Cheers!

My only issue is with one distributer you utilize that charges me the California sales tax even though the order ships to Alaska where I live. I purchase a number of items that are difficult to find in Alaska and when I make the purchase I am never charged the sales tax since I reside in Alaska. I wish this one distributer would get this figured and quit charging me the tax.

I have returned and it was ok, I have asked about something regarding followers that support couldn't help, anyway, I have understood and it was ok, but, since last version, nothing works here, I don't receive any notification and I was forced to open my profile because I couldn't receive the notifications from followers. After 15 days, nothing was solved. Unfortunately, it has became a very sad and bad experience. In the beginning we had a small crew, but now, fortunately, it is bigger... anyway, bigger in problems too and inconvenient people. With this situation, a block button is needed. But I have erased all my wines, because I was receiving messages in other posts and I didn't now because I don't receive notifications as I've said. Profit is good, you deserve it, greed and lack of respect is bad and I think it will not work in the future. Thank you very much.

vivino	US	What you should know about Vivino support!	15 March 2018	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I am a long time member and love the app. I have bought many bottles over the years and caused others to buy as well. Last fall I sent a link to a 100 point wine to our CEO because I believed it to be wine he (and I) would enjoy as well as a great deal. The delivery was to be in December in time for the holidays. Today (March 15), I received an email from him saying that the wine is MIA. I wrote to customer support and a few Sr. execs at Vivino asking for help in finding the $1,300 case of wine.Within minutes, I heard form a few of the execs and Jackie in customer support. She did the research and found a shipping report that indicated a delivery in early December that was signed by the CEO's wife. She unpacked the case stuck it in the cellar and forgot to tell him. The wine is found, all is great and a big thanks to the Vivino team for saving my bacon.I have and will continue to send Vivino recommendations to all of my friends.

vivino	GB	Customer service emails are not monitored, even for premium users	28 February 2018	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Edit: I have updated this review to indicate that Vivino failed for several weeks to process a refund, even with the seller pressing them to do so. They still haven‚Äôt replied to any of my 5 emails to their orders, gb.orders or support @ vivino.com email addresses. A customer service assistant using the app told me they couldn‚Äôt even find the emails.Previous review: I got off on the wrong foot with Vivino‚Äôs ordering system. My first visit to the sales site, I tried to order 6 wines, thus qualifying for free delivery. This proved tricky, on account of the array of stores on offer, which are hard to navigate between. In the end, a website error logged me out and erased the haul I‚Äôd spent half an hour researching.I still think the website needs an overhaul - it should be much easier to see all the wines on offer from a given store - but I did eventually find a solution.After a dragged-out back and forth with their unresponsive customer service, who repeatedly asked me for information I‚Äôd already provided, I was finally given a three-month premium account by way of apology. The premium service offers free delivery of any wine, even if you only order one. That means it‚Äôs possible to find the highest-rated wines going, and to buy them as if from the supermarket. Delivery is quick and reliable, and the user-rating system leads to pretty consistently great selections.
vivino	CH	Exploiting candidate's feedback? maybe	27 February 2018	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	This is what happened: I was supposed to have an interview for a position with this company. Before the interview, they sent me different questions on how to improve Vivino website strategy, on how to maximize the basket size and increment conversion for shopping cart. I spent some time to answer those questions providing back to them a 3 page document with answers. 5 months later, they never scheduled interview and they never let me know the feedback, neither a rejection automatic mail. They completely disappeared. I never had the interview and they maybe used somehow the answers collected not only from me but from many other candidates for knowing what their users think of their website. Abusing/exploiting the time of candidates/users is not a great company strategy for sure.
vivino	GB	Merchant Feedback	23 February 2018	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	I have bought wine many times from Vivino and had a great experience. I have tried to contact on three occasions in regards to setting up a merchant account. I have not had anything more come of this after the 'Welcome to Vivino' email.Could I please have someone look into this?Kind regards,Patrick Gaunt
vivino	US	i tried to order 4 times	20 February 2018	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	i tried to order 4 times - they couldn't deliver to my state, (but took the order) , cancelled by mistake was out of stock -let's see if 4th time works - cust service is late and bad go elsewhere
vivino	US	Customer service stinks!	14 February 2018	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Customer service stinks. No contact phone so you cannot correct any ordering errors immediately.1.They answered a website inquiry in a week not a day. Then referred my inquiery to senior staff and Senior staff  just closed the case without responding.2.The website had a default that allowed them to send me the wrong vintages. I tried to notify them immediately but there is no phone # and no one got back to me until after the wine was delivered.  Rather than offering to credit me or even send someone to pick up the wine to return it they just left all the inconvenience up to me. 3. Their delivery service damaged my wine and I had to figure out why I never got my wine, no support or response from Vivino until I researched the reason and sent them the documentation. Then fine, they would refund my $$, no replacement available.Buyer Beware!
vivino	US	Beware-may be a scam	10 February 2018	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Beware, I ordered $1,000 worth of wine a week ago, they charged my credit card right away and sent an order confirmation.  Week later, no wine, no communication, no expected delivery, nothing.  Now I think I‚Äôve been scammed.  If I don‚Äôt hear from them soon I will request the charge be stopped through my credit card company.Edit...wish I read the reviews before I ordered.  Same problems others experienced.  Too bad.
vivino	AU	Authentic	08 February 2018	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	I found some seriously authentic reviews here.
vivino	US	Non-existent customer service	08 February 2018	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	They are fine until you need their ‚Äúcustomer service.‚Äù  Their little secret is they have no actual customer service. I know several fledgling businesses with much lower sales volumes that at least pay some folks in lower income international countries to answer a phone and respond to customer issues and questions. Not Vivino. They have no number and only a forwarded inbox address that they episodically reply from.  They tout a one business day response time, but I‚Äôve pinged them for over a week and only received one generic ‚ÄúWe are sorry, but looking into it!‚Äù type of useless email. If you never need their customer service, then it was a fine. However, if you have an issue or question, and really need customer service, avoid at all costs.
vivino	DK	Been drinking better wine ever since I ‚Ä¶	07 February 2018	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Been drinking better wine ever since I discover their app. Thanks!
vivino	US	The customer service for this company ‚Ä¶terrible	31 January 2018	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	The customer service for this company is horrible.  I placed an order on December 20th.  After not receiving my order or any communication as to why I had not received it I emailed their customer service on January 11th inquiring about the order.  Apparently the order was damaged during delivery and they were in the process of re-shipping me a new box (2-day shipping at no additional cost to me!!  How generous of them)!!  Never was I notified of any issues with shipping.  At this point I canceled the order and requested a refund.  It is now January 31st and I still have not received my refund.  There is no phone # I can find to reach out to a live person.  Unacceptable!!
vivino	GB	This company has no customer service team	21 January 2018	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	I've ordered 3 times from this supplier. One was OK, the second not and the third is as yet untried.After this delivery I contacted the company to inform that the wine was mis-described on their website which said it was 13.5%, the bottle says 13%, this was more in the nature of assistance to them than a complaint..My first email was not replied to after 2 days so I sent a repeat message which also has not been replied to.I don't htink this company has a customer service team which is probably why sorting out problems seems to be a major issue
vivino	US	My wine arrived damaged	16 January 2018	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	My wine arrived damaged.  I was asked to give them an additional business day to try to replace the bottles; that was over a week ago.  They are now radio silent.  This was my first order with Vivino, not sure, based on this experience, I can give them another try.  Too bad.  Great selection and good prices.

vivino	GB	Don‚Äôt buy your wine from this crew	28 December 2017	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Don‚Äôt buy your wine from this crew! Promised for Xmas and never arrived. Very poor customer service thereafter. Kept promising to ‚Äúfully investigate‚Äù but heard no more thereafter. Then demanded a refund which has apparently happened but not a word of apology. If time is of the essence then avoid this lot.
vivino	US	Paid $83 for overnight delivery, wasn't provided.	23 December 2017	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Paid $83 for overnight delivery.  When vivino shipped delivery was scheduled for 4 days later.  They did not indicate a later delivery in order confirmation. Why would I pay for overnight delivery if it wasn't going to be overnight.Never again!
vivino	GB	Avoid this company at all costs.	17 December 2017	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Avoid this company at all costs.I ordered 6 bottles of red and 6 bottles of white wine from them. They took my money immediately but then nothing happened for a few weeks. I emailed them to find out when the wine was going to be delivered-  they then sent the red wine but only 2 bottles of the white. I tried to contact them by telephone to find out why I only had 2 white but had paid for 6 (they were $50 per bottle) - but there is no published number for the company. I emailed several times asking them for the missing 4 whites and for them to call me. They never called me. They take 2 days to respond to email. Then they sent 4 more bottles of the red, i.e. the wrong wine (it was less than half the price of the white). I emailed several times again asking what was going on. They never called me but emailed asked me to send the incorrect delivery back and added that they didn't have any of the white wine that I had ordered and paid for left. They promised to refund my money for the missing wine. I sent the wine that had been incorrectly delivered back to them, which they have received, but they now say that I have received the 'missing' bottles of white wine and have not refunded my money. They are either incompetent or fraudulent.
vivino	DK	Super service	31 October 2017	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Always quick delivery. Pleased with most of the wines so far. Had a bad wine purchased more than a year ago, was immediately reimbursed, Super Service
vivino	DK	Fast delivery and quick response to my issue	25 October 2017	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Fast delivery, shipment as expected, but also very good response and no hassle when communicating with support. Excellent.
vivino	DK	Still room for improvement.	20 October 2017	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	The reason for only 4 stars is, as mentioned by others, the billing procedure. Where money are drawn immideately when ordering. Post Nord managed to destroy the first delivery, but the customer service has been flawless, friendly and very helpful.For the Danish delivery I will suggest you to consider shifting to another delivery company. Despite direct order and sign on our postbox that delivery shall be placed behind the house. Post Nord has once again managed to place the package in front of the house, begging for someone to come and pick it up.

vivino	US	I was a regular customer for many years ‚Ä¶	07 October 2017	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I was a regular customer for many years yet I was never pleased with the fact that they bill immediately and always ship late.  they have no customer service number which should have been a red flag too.  I just placed a big order for more than $1000 and the delivery not only weeks late,  was short the most expensive bottle $560. luckily I have the proof to contest the order. typical case of buyer beware. will never order from vivino again.
vivino	GB	Dishonest service.	27 September 2017	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Happy to take my money but never deliver despite promises, my impression is that Vivino is/are a scam.  Avoid at all cost!
vivino	US	I have used this app to search wines ‚Ä¶Slow delivery.  Poor service	20 September 2017	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	"I have used this app to search wines and assess prices for several years.  Sometimes you can buy the wines cheaper at Costco.  I decided to finally order a highly rated Malbec and added some other wines to cap off the order.  I ordered on Set 4th knowing that we were traveling.  My wines were not delivered until Set.18th and two bottles just arrived today.  When I expressed concern to customer service the response was,""I understand why you would feel that way.""  Poor problem resolution.  without improved reviews I will not order again.  Too bad.  Maybe their wines are good."
vivino	IT	Potentially useful, but access is broken	02 September 2017	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Used to use this.  Liked it.Installed in on my Android phone today. Wouldn't let me use my existing google credentials or anything else. It made me try to open a new account.  But wouldn't let me because my existing email name is in use.  Incompetent interface needs to be fixed otherwise useless.
vivino	US	Poor Customer Experience	25 August 2017	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Poor Customer Experience. Terrible customer service. Advertised 3-5 days shipping. It has been 10 days and still not able to track the package. They do not have a phone number. Everything is done by email and promise 24 hour response. This is not true either. After 2 days waiting I am told it is usually 10 days. I am now going to attempt to cancel my order and find another company to work with.
vivino	US	Deceptive Advertising	23 July 2017	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	Ordered 6 bottles of what was advertised as a Stags Leap wine at a supposed 42% discount.  Wine arrived on time but was from some unknown winery and I later determined the cost savings was falsely advertised.  This company is not providing great deals.  Closely evaluate their ads before ordering.  You can probably do better at Total Wine.  Email transactions with Vivino yielded no satisfaction.
vivino	US	Wine ordered 4 weeks ago	11 July 2017	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Wine ordered 4 weeks ago.  No delivery.  No explanation.  Just canned responses.  Stay away!
vivino	US	Worst Experience	03 July 2017	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	"I placed an order on 6/21/2017, but till now I didn't receive any shipping information. I tried to contact the customer service several time, but didn't receive any updates of my order. The only message I received is the auto reply ""Thank you for contacting Vivino's Customer Experience Team. We will begin to review your email and get back to you within one business day (or less). Until then, we hope you're enjoying a glass of wine!"". What's the one business day meaning?This is a really bad experience!"
vivino	US	My first experience with Vivino.com and ‚Ä¶	26 June 2017	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	My first experience with Vivino.com and probably my last! Ordered 6 bottles of wine 11 days ago and have not even received shipping information yet. I sent an email last week and they told me they would look into it but haven't heard back from them yet even after a second email to them. They promise a reply in one business day or less but they sure don't live up to that! It's no wonder they don't post their telephone number on their website.Update! I responded to their request for order number through Trustpilot and they replied in what I am guessing is Dutch? Unbelievable!
vivino	DK	mega fed app!	12 May 2017	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	
vivino	US	Bad customer service, misleading shipping times	01 March 2017	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Ordered wine 2/4/17- it is not 3/1 and shipment has not arrived. Customer service stated wine began shipment via truck 2/16 and then has to arrive to northeast where UPS/fedex will ship. Still nothing and no answer from customer service. Horrible.
vivino	DK	Fast and easy help via app	07 April 2016	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I really enjoy using vivino app when I cannot decide which wine should I chose. It is a very big help and super easy to use. Also, you can share your own experience about the wine and compare it to others. I definitely recommend to try it out.

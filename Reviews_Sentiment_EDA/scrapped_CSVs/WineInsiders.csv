WineInsiders	US	They need to take responsibility for their mistakes	25 August 2023	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	My issue is not necessarily with the wine itself (because I just got my order) but with the delivery process.  I specifically requested that it be delivered to a local Dollar General because not only was I going to be out of town that week, but I didn't want it to be delivered in my conservative neighborhood.  The FedEx guy attempted to deliver it to my house and when we didn't answer the door, he gave it to my neighbor who signed for it.  I ended up getting it when I got home but the problem is that WineInsiders didn't take responsibility for this.  They blamed FedEx.  The FedEx guy just delivered it to the address on the box and gave it to my neighbor when I didn't answer the door.  That sounds like a Wine Insiders issue to me.
WineInsiders	US	Putrid	28 August 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	"In a word. . .crap. Husband insists on continuing to do business with them as he likes the wine selections better than what he can get in a store. Not worth it to me tho because I have a life too and it's a pain in the ass to either go out of the way to FedEx Office to pick the monthly box up or wait at home ALL DAMN DAY FOR IT as it is alcohol and needs ""an adult signature.""  Still who in the 21st century waits anymore all day at home for a delivery? That law needs to be changed especially since I was stupid, left the house at the wrong time to go shopping today and FedEx who along with Wine Insiders botched the delivery method attempting to deliver it here unbeknownst to me for the next to last time instead of taking it to FedEx Office per hub's request FOR HIM TO PICK UP.  It never ceases to amaze me how many unnecessary errors these inept asses have made and hopefully either one day that signature won't be required or another better company and option will come along.  Till then I'm waiting for Godot both for a better option as well as for the dreaded delivery which if I happen to be home and available all day will not come till end of the day most times. Thanx for being so considerate of my time."
WineInsiders	US	Their customer service is HORRIBLE	20 June 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Their customer service is deteriorating. I have been trying to resolve a damaged, reshipped, and now returned order for 8 days. The latest is the address THEY provide on their website for a pick up location, no longer accepts wine. What?! They are full of excuses but no solutions. I demanded a supervisor to reroute my delivery to another drop off, and the idiot did the order again. This is the 3rd redo of the same order. But FedEX site shows it out for delivery. Baffled!
WineInsiders	US	Definitely No Scam In My Book!	13 June 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	In all of the years and numerous bottles of wine consumed, I have never had a bad experience with WI. There have been several times that I was either unhappy with a bottle or 2 and recently a shipment of 5; the wine was always replaced promptly, at no charge and to my satisfaction. I've been through the 'weeding out' process of trying various kinds/types of wines and have now settled on a few select favorites. This is not to say that I won't 'dip my toe' into the unknown pool again but I have every confidence about my future orders from WI. I do agree that FedEx is a far-from-perfect delivery service like they were once upon a time. Cheers!

WineInsiders	US	CUSTOMER SERVICE	02 February 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	CUSTOMER SERVICE, WHAT CUSTOMER SERVICE? THEY NEVER GET BACK TO YOU OR ANSWER EMAILS. THEY EMPTY MY CARTS. THE LAST 3 CARTS I MADE THEY EMPTIED SO I NEVER MADE ANOTHER ORDER AFTER ORDERING 5 TIMES. IT SEEMS WINE INSIDERS DOESN’T WANT MY BUSINESS. I HAVE TOLD THEM NUMBEROUS TIMES CHARGING A PROCESSING FEE IS NO FREE SHIPPING. GIVE ME 50% OFF WITH NO PROCESSING FEE, I'LL MAKE MY 6TH ORDER OTHERWISE WINE INSIDERS IS A SCAM AND I'LL BUY MY WINE ELSEWHERE.
WineInsiders	US	These guys are total rip off.	01 January 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	These guys are total rip off.. They won’t deliver the package on promised date and totally spoiled my holiday plans. And when asked about returning the items they are charging more than the total order amount for the return. What a poor service!!
WineInsiders	US	Scam	12 January 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Scam. Many people received an offer with their AMEX card for cash back on a purchase that excluded use of promo codes. Everything on the website is always “on sale” so no purchase was valid at all. After finding out, I tried to cancel the order (2 hours later) and they refused. Was told there would be a huge restocking fee if I refused delivery. Found out this happens to many others don’t trust this site
WineInsiders	US	Wine Insiders Delivery Issues	03 August 2021	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	Wine Insiders has a nice selection of wines and some very nice wine special offerings. Their only shipping carrier option, however, is FedEx Home, a subsidiary of FedEx Ground, comprised of lazy independent contractors. I would not recommend this wine merchant if you reside in an apartment building (especially without any means to travel to a FedEx pickup location). Wine Insiders' Customer Service is not helpful in resolving shipment issues with the carrier, but they issue a prompt refund to the customer once an order is returned to their warehouse by FedEx.

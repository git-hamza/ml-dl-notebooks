winedirect	GB	Would give no stars if I could	21 August 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Would give no stars if I could.  Ordered some very nice wine for my brother-in-laws 60th birthday, wine status has been pending since.  Have made numerous phone calls and online enquiries, all have been ignored.   If this company is having problems, stop taking orders and start talking to the customers whose money you have taken.  I'll be contacting my credit card company today to start a chargeback claim (as it was under £100), and I'll be contacting Trading Standards.   Biggest regret is I didn't check Trust Pilot before ordering, I will do in future for companies I've not dealt with before.
winedirect	GB	This is a scam… order wines two months…	08 August 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	This is a scam… order wines two months ago. On the website still says pending. They’ve taken my money immediately after the order. Sent various emails, nor reply; called their only number which apparently is not available. Save your time and money, don’t buy from this, at best unprofessional, company.
winedirect	GB	Poor service and communication	15 September 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Poor service and communication (not answering phone or responding to email) seems to be a recurring theme. I eventually got 50% of my order that's me done with them  having been a customer for nearly 10 years. They have always had a great range of wines but for whatever reason their ability to fulfil orders and communicate with customers has gown downhill these last few years
winedirect	GB	Wish I had read the trustpilot reviews	17 September 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Wish I had read the trustpilot reviews. £155 out of pocket, no communication, no response at all to my many calls messages and emails. And more importantly NO wine. I’m not sure how to get my money back, but I will be trying ….
winedirect	GB	STAY CLEAR OF THIS COMPANY!!!	25 September 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Would give 0 stars if I could - absolute shambles of a company. Placed and paid for my wine order 24 Aug - a month later and status when I check is still 'Pending', and no one answers the phone when you call the number listed on their site, just rings and rings until it goes to voicemail! Hoping I'll be able to get my money back!
winedirect	GB	Arrived after months	18 May 2023	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	I ordered wine in May 2023. After reading reviews I had pretty much kissed goodbye to my money. No response when I sent an enquiry. However, suddenly yesterday my order status was updated to packed and it arrived today - no items missing.So, customer service terrible but I'm just grateful that I did receive it eventually
winedirect	GB	Great local wine company	01 September 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Regularly order my wine from here and always pleased with the selection available. Fast service and would definitely recommend - team there are very knowledgeable
winedirect	GB	Same experience!	19 September 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I really wish I could say something different than had already been said but sadly not. Ordered some hard to get Barolo but a month later my order remains “pending”. I did get a couple of email responses from Helen promising delivery “next week” but sadly next week never came. I even offered to visit the business as it’s only a few miles away from me but they didn’t reply to this. Not sure what’s going on with this retailer but there are clearly some significant issues. Would advise people to avoid them! I managed to get a refund from my credit card company!
winedirect	GB	No wine, no comms, no refund, no service... stay away	15 August 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Order placed 15/08/2023 for one case of wine. No communications, no estimated delivery, very frustrating. I did once get through on the phone and I was PROMISED a delivery, but it never arrived. That was two weeks ago. Now they don't answer the phone at all, ever. This company is really cheating customers. I stupidly paid by debit card, and not credit card, or I would have got the card vendor involved and claimed a refund. This company is a bunch of sharks... only buy here if you want to make a charitable donation... as you will never see your wine.
winedirect	GB	Poor Customer Service	02 August 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	On 2nd August, I ordered a few bottles of nice wine for an event ten days later and spent almost £100. The order just stayed as ‘pending’. Once the event passed I requested a refund - four different times. Eventually, a nice lady called to apologise and said she would issue an immediate refund; that was three weeks ago. I have chased this again but never expect to get my money back.
winedirect	GB	Do not buy wine from these guys. Doesn't even deserve the 1 star	21 September 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	doesn't even deserve the 1 star. I have waited over three months now and tried phoning several times as well as sending e-mails to no avail. This is a terrible way to treat people and what they are doing is illegal.Their site should be banned from advertising.
winedirect	AU	Appears to be plain theft	09 September 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Appears to be plain theft. I spent nearly £100 on 9th September for a very special gift for a once in a lifetime occasion. After a couple of days the link to my order update, which had read ‘pending’, led to a blank page. A huge alarm bell obviously. I have emailed, used their contact form, posted on their Facebook page, and used the email address on their Facebook page (it bounced).
winedirect	GB	Do not use!	06 September 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	"Do not buy! They will ""pending"" your order and you'll never receive anything. Get your money back via contacting your bank and setting up a charge-back dispute."
winedirect	GB	Having been reassured my order would…	18 September 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Having been reassured my order would imminently arrive since the 7th of May I now realise I will never receive the goods. I have been unable to reach the company by phone to again be reassured of their struggles to meet my order. I will never do business with this company again!
winedirect	GB	Customer service has not improved.. be very careful	20 September 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	My order was on 8th July.  No news or update until I started phoning.  Issues with the warehouse, then it was being brought into the country.  Promises of it being delivered never went through.  After three days just now of calling the company up to ten times throughout the day trying to reach someone (it just went to voicemail) I gave up fearing the worst and initiated a dispute via my credit card company for non-delivery hoping to get my money back.  I let the company know this yesterday by phone message and by email.  Today, unannounced, the wine has been delivered so I did eventually receive something, unlike some of the other reviews.  However it is 2022 and not 2018 as promised (ordered 2017 which became out of stock) so very little information on how it is drinking/will be drinking.  Whatever their issues are, I am not going through two months of worry again that I may have been defrauded.  I can no longer trust what I may be told by them with regard to my order.
winedirect	GB	Absolutely appalling company	14 September 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Absolutely appalling company, ordered wine on 3rd July 2023, its now the 14th of September and nothing! No updates, they dont answer the phone or written enquiries. Why are companies like this allowed to continue to trade. I plan on turning up at their premises and causing merry hell. SCAMMERS!!!! DO NOT USE THIS LOT!
winedirect	CA	Scam or just catastrophically badly organised?	29 June 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I ordered a bottle of wine on June 29th 2023 for my brother-in-law's birthday. It never arrived, though the money left my Visa account on the same day. I asked for an update on August 2nd... no reply. Repeated my request for a progress report on August 30th. Still no reply. I see from the Trustpilot site that the company changed hands in June, and hope that the new owner didn't pay too much for it, because the service sucks, as is confirmed by the fact that as of today, 53% of their reviews are one-star. I don't know if this execrable service is caused by inefficiency or dishonesty, but either way, AVOID THEM LIKE THE PLAGUE!
winedirect	GB	Excellent	19 June 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Recently read the Trustpilot reviews ,with entrapadation, there was no need ...James as just recently taken over the business ,and with all new businesses ,it takes time to iron out ALL issues ,which I am sure James will do .Upon order ,delivery was 2 weeks .A company I will be using again for there superb SA wine selection alone WELL DONE ..
winedirect	GB	Non Existent Customer Service	14 September 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Ordered some fine back in July and still has not arrived,  which can happen from time to time.  What I am finding extremely disappointing is that have left telephone messages and emailed a number of times and am yet to get a response.  What happed to good old customer service.
winedirect	GB	The wines I ordered are now available. Hope they can turn things around.	28 August 2023	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	This is an update on my previous review.The wines I ordered from this company are now available and I hope that they will be able to turn things around.
winedirect	GB	Ordered wine on August 31st and…	31 August 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Ordered wine on August 31st and confirmed with order processing but nothing since. Numerous emails and phone calls were unanswered.Have requested refund from credit card. DO NOT USE THIS FRAUDULENT website.
winedirect	GB	Similar experience to all those below	13 September 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Similar experience to all those below.  Ordered 6 bottles on 2nd June.  Only 4 arrived.  Since then no replies to e-mails and phone always goes to answerphone.  No reply to messages left.  Unsure what more can be done but this company should not be trading.
winedirect	GB	Quality wines great prices	17 August 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	We received great quality wines at great prices with fast efficient delivery- thank you!
winedirect	GB	I have been waiting for a delivery…	19 September 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I have been waiting for a delivery since May 23. I have tried to call the company on a number of occasions, but never managed to speak to anyone.
winedirect	GB	Really surprised at the other reviews	20 June 2023	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	Really surprised at the other reviews. I’ve been using wine direct for a while and have only good things to say. The service has been helpful, recommending some great wines tailored to my taste and my price range and I will continue to use them for as long as my glass needs filling.
winedirect	GB	Terrible service and communication	14 July 2023	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	4 bottles ordered for a special birthday present - no communication so phoned to be told they only had 2 but would send them and get the agent to send the rest directly to me. Next day 2 bottles did arrive but a week later nothing else. Was told yesterday this would be followed up. Phoned this morning to hear recorded message saying they are closed until 24th!! Why wasn’t I told this!!  Very disappointed and angry that I now won’t  have the full order for the intended present.
winedirect	GB	Excellent	28 June 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	James provided me with some brilliant advice on twelve bottles of red. Ordered yesterday and delivered today. Excellent service. Very happy. If like me, you don't know a great deal about wine, I would urge you to call the company prior to placing an order. Wine is clearly their passion, and they were very happy to offer suggestions and advice. Couldn't ask for more. Thank you very much!
winedirect	GB	Great selection of wines and accurately…	16 March 2023	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	Great selection of wines and accurately delivered at pretty good prices. However customer service is a ZERO. Takes an eternity to dispatch the goods although when dispatched they arrived within 24 hours. I ordered on 1st March and eventually they arrived on 16th. They did not answer any emails. Why does it take so long. Perhaps someone from WineDirect could provide an explanation
winedirect	GB	New ownership has made meaningful change to customer service	30 June 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I, like others, had made an order that was stuck on pending after a couple weeks with no contact. It was a large order and I was somewhat worried about it arriving on time (or at all). However after receiving an email explaining the change in ownership I rang up and spoke to a very helpful person who explained why the order was delayed and sorted out some acceptable substitutes of equal or higher quality. The order was shipped that very day and arrived the next which was exceptional, right on time for the event I was ordering for.  Everything was accounted for and some of the substitutes were actually much nicer than I had ordered, so they did right by me.  I think I am happy to say that the new ownership seems to have made real changes and that my experience afterwards was significantly different to beforehand.  Hopefully this continues.
winedirect	GB	Total shambles	08 September 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Avoid this company - absolute shambles. Ordered 6 bottles of wine in May 2023 and still no sign of it 18 weeks later. They do not answer the phone nor respond to emails. Am seeking to recover monies through section 75 Consumer Credit Act route having asked for full refund.
winedirect	GB	Great Service	29 June 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	First time using this company and I would definitely recommend, very happy.Great selection of wines, delivery was prompt and arrived on the expected delivery date, as promised. Will definitely be ordering from them again.Thank you
winedirect	GB	Takes bloody ages but good selection	14 December 2022	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	Have shopped with WineDirect a few times over the past decade - sadly last iteration clearly didn't work out that well hence many negative reviews here. The new operation looks very much the same and sadly suffers from the same issue - they take ages to move forward on orders, don't update much but then deliver very swiftly as soon as the order is processed. Advice is don't buy if you need it in a hurry.
winedirect	GB	Ordered wine - No wine arrived, no contact from company	20 September 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Ordered wine, it's been a month already. No response to any email, no-one picks up the phone on any day of the week. I have reported the company to trading standards.
winedirect	IE	Received my wine after a very nice call…	25 August 2023	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	Received my wine after a very nice call from Helen plus a complimentary bottle due to delay.   Pity it took so much to get the wine moving but I understand Helen was out for a while.  Thanks Helen
winedirect	GB	Great all-around service	26 May 2019	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Avoided this company before due to bad reviews. As it's under new ownership, thought I'd give it a try. Spoke to customer service for some wine advice, who were polite and knowledgeable. Wine arrived in good time and well packaged. And most importantly, lovely wines. Will definitely be ordering from them again.
winedirect	GB	Great service; fantastic surprise!!	12 June 2020	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Fantastic! Not only do Wine Direct stock what is probably my favourite, sensibly priced, wine in Greywacke Wild sauvignon but as they ran out of one of the bottles I ordered I also got a surprise bottle of Dog point Section 94. Never had this before but if it drinks as well as it sounds I may well have a new favourite. One very happy customer who will definitely be returning.
winedirect	GB	WHAT A DIFFERENCE.The new owners have…	04 October 2019	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	WHAT A DIFFERENCE.The new owners have certainly turned this Company around,and customer satisfaction is now their top priority as well as selling top quality wines at fair prices.They kept me informed on the progress of my order on a daily basis either by phone or e-mails so always knew the status of my order.Will certainly be placing further orders with this Company in the future
winedirect	GB	Top Notch	31 December 2020	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I live in deepest Aberdeenshire, about as far from Sussex as you can get. I've ordered from Wine Direct twice now and they've been faultless.  5 Stars all the way with  an excellent, broad choice of quality wines, first class customer care, friendly and helpful staff, and very speedy delivery to over 500 miles away.
winedirect	GB	Fantastic and reliable service!	04 March 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I recently ordered a special bottle of wine as a treat during this lockdown period. I called windirect.co.uk and was helped by Helen who gave fantastic service! Helen knows her wines very well and was very helpful and reassuring on timelines involved with sourcing the wine and delivery. I highly recommend contacting them when ordering  as they provide great service and have a selection of unique and special bottles of wine you can treat yourself with!!
winedirect	GB	May you prevail and prosper.	13 May 2020	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Having made 2 purchases now with this wine merchant. I can honestly say. I've been highly delighted with the way both of my orders have been processed. Even in the  country's current situation, both orders have arrived in a reasonable timescale.It's nice to see you can track your order all the way to your door. I'm also impressed with the packaging of the products. Double boxed, Proper separators.You deserve credit.
winedirect	GB	Happy Customer !	28 April 2023	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	Unusually I read the Reviews after placing my order so my expectations were low. Happy to report that the wine arrived within 2 weeks. I chased after 10 days week and they did call back promptly including a phone call from them to ask if I was happy to have 1 bottle substituted as the one we wanted was held up in customs. After the phone call the wine arrived 24 hours later. Would use again but not if I was in a hurry.
winedirect	GB	Shipping issue + good resolution by the owner	04 April 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Experienced a delay in my order due to shipping issues, but the owner Helen gave me a call this morning to apologise and offer both a refund + goodwill voucher. Will be sure to give them another try on my next order.
winedirect	GB	Dreadful	04 September 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Dreadful. Order processed and accepted on 21 July 2023. Nothing heard by 04 September 2023 despite email reminders sent by me to WD (but no replies from WD received). Ive now asked for a refund. Fortunately I paid with a credit card. Buyer beware!!!
winedirect	GB	Quality Wines, Keen Prices, Exceptional Service	21 May 2019	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	"This is simply the best on-line wine company in the UK. The quality and range of wines is exceptional. The prices are competitive and the overall level of customer service is exceptional. I used various wines shops/brokers for various types of wine in the past - Wine Direct Sussex is now the only place to go. Weddings, Corporate gifts or weekend tipples, they do it all. Helen and the team are experts in their field, this combined with their ""customer first"" attitude will blow you away. They are  leaders in their field and set the bar for all other competitors!!!"
winedirect	GB	Not wine deals direct!	09 March 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I previously wrote a 1 star review as I had received awful service from WINE DEALS DIRECT.  My error! This company were quite rightly upset by my review as it was incorrect.  They remained professional and bless them kindly understanding and said they get this confusion often.  Such a shame that another companies bad service can have a negative effect on their business. I've since removed my 1 star review and will add it to the correct company. Wine Direct please accept my sincere apology and those reading this please learn from my silly mistake and don't get these 2 companies mixed up as they are chalk and cheese
winedirect	GB	AVOID THIS COMPANY	01 September 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Same experience as most. Made a £700 order in July. Heard nothing. After chasing by email and phone I finally got a call in mid August saying that their new system meant they weren’t receiving emails or calls. Really??  They promised to send the wine immediately. Naturally it never arrived. Have been chasing by email and phone again but no one ever picks up or responds. Will now need to take whatever action is necessary to recover my £700. Everyone should avoid this company.
winedirect	GB	Excellent and Friendly Service	07 January 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	We purchased a number of gift vouchers for various clients over the Christmas/New Year period, rather than wine, which made it a complicated order.  This then needed to be changed on several occasions and Helen could not have been more helpful or understanding.  We would highly recommend Wine Direct and will certainly use them again in the future.
winedirect	GB	Good customer service.	04 December 2019	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I think if i'd looked at trustpilot before I wouldn't have ordered but I am glad that I did. Wine arrived in less than a week from ordering. Good communication from the customer service team.There was some variation in vintages and wines (one was replaced with a more expensive one from the same producer) but as I ticked that box I can't complain. One thing to note is that many of the old vintages which are out of stock are still up on the site so if you absolutely have to have a particular vintage, it's probably worth checking first.
winedirect	GB	Thanks again Jason another job well done.	10 October 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Thanks again Jason another job well done ordered my Louis Royer VSOP cognac on Thursday morning received emails to keep me updated and received my order via Parcelforce on Saturday morning.Thanks Eddie
winedirect	GB	First time I have ordered…	24 December 2020	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	First time I have ordered from wine direct and I will be again. I contacted wines direct regarding my order and they were fantastic. The response was quick and I had the wine well before I was expecting it. That amazing under normal circumstances but during this pandemic and Brexit looming that's special. Will be ordering all my wine from wine direct from no on.
winedirect	GB	These guys really know their stuff!	04 June 2019	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	These guys really know their stuff. I was looking for a particular wine which they didn't have on their website but were able to source it for me really quickly. The previous reviews here are for the previous owners who have seemingly now left the business.Lovely people to deal with, and I would thoroughly recommend them for any wine / alcohol based query.
winedirect	GB	Dependable	23 November 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I have only used Wine Direct a couple of times, and I have only used them for wines that I had difficulty in locating elsewhere.  I found them after I placed an order with another company which simply seemed to vanish.  I have found them to be friendly and reliable, and easy to contact on the telephone.
winedirect	GB	Good service.	16 August 2019	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	Received mixed case, well packed and wines as requested. Bin ends good value, though one of the wines has signs of damp on the labels. Should have no effect on the wine. Responsive supplier with good communications. Will use again on this experience.
winedirect	GB	Great service & speedy delivery!	11 February 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I was looking online for a cheap and cheerful bottle of wine I had while on holiday, I was so happy to find it on Wine Direct. I added a nicer bottle of white later to find out that it was on backorder. The kind sales rep notified me with similar options and in the end sent me with a wine of greater value. It was such a nice treat heading into the weekend. Her service was over the top, I will definitely be reordering from them again!
winedirect	GB	Matter Resolved	11 May 2023	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	I am updating previous post. I placed an order 20/3 and received part delivery 5/4. It was difficult to get through to customer service but the matter has now been resolved very fairly and honourably by Wine Direct (Sussex) Ltd.
winedirect	GB	First time using this site	10 April 2020	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	First time using Wine Direct. Placed an order on 31.03.20. Wine arrived 08.04.20. I was pleasantly surprised as I expected a bit of a delay in the current climate. Wine was securely packaged. Ordered the Spee Wah Shiraz which is delicious. Would definitely order from Wine Direct again.
winedirect	GB	Under New Ownership	13 May 2019	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	Under New OwnershipHave not used them for a while because of the reviews from the previous owners . Tried them again only because I received a new ownership email.  I was a bit nervous but no need, wine ordered and delivered on time actually managed to speak to someone and expressed my concerns who appeared to understand how I felt and was quiet sympathetic.This site always had fabulous wines at good prices , hopefully the new companies customer service will finally be up to scratch !
winedirect	GB	Curates Egg	18 May 2023	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	Firstly - a big thank you to the reviewers on here who may have made the difference between me getting my wine and not. I had the same experience as others and looking at the reviews thought that the company was probably going out of business. So I used a little known specific legal action threat to focus minds. Hey presto - within 48 hours the wine arrived, beautifully packed and as per order (except with some substitutions, which I had allowed, which turned out to be upgrades). And a review of the most recent accounts shows the company (at that time) to be easily solvent.So what's going on? I chose the title of my review deliberately. Like the famed curates egg, they seem to be good in parts. The wine selection is great and when you get on their backs they really do well. And yet they give a pretty good outward impression of a chaotic mess that's soon going to go bust. Hopefully they turn it round and the scores go up - because that would be good for us all!
winedirect	GB	A great company is one that can solve an issue	19 February 2020	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I found this company to be extremely efficient. I did have a problem with the delivery which could not be helped but they leapt to correct it and were extremely pleasant to deal with. They went above and beyond to keep their customer happy which for an online ordering system I felt was a rare thing these days.  Would recommend highly.
winedirect	GB	Fantastic service	14 May 2020	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Brilliant service from Wine Direct. Very swift delivery of my order up to Edinburgh and very helpful staff. I accidentally ordered too much and Helen amended my order and arranged an instant refund.  I’ll definitely use them again.
winedirect	GB	A Birthday Order	20 February 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I ordered 6 bottles of MAN Skaapveld red wine for a birthday present. I know this wine tastes delicious and I had no hesitation ordering it.  However, Wine Direct was a company I had not used before and I was a little apprehensive because my order was a gift and I didn't want to disappoint the recipient.Ordering was easy and the whole process was painless.   Wine Direct's website was easy to navigate and there was plenty of information regarding the product and the delivery process.  The Birthday preset was very well received and the gift card added an extra layer of surprise.  I will definitely use this company again to purchase more wine.Thanks, Guys for getting all the processes in place for hassle free shopping.
winedirect	GB	Great wines	04 December 2019	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I have to say that these guys are great! I received exactly what I ordered and it arrived on time. I have recently passed my WSET level 3 wine exams and it’s great to find a large diversity of wines from all the global wine areas to further my wine tasting education. You can’t fault the service and I am looking forward to ordering more, thank you!
winedirect	GB	i placed an order solely on the basis…	20 July 2020	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	i placed an order solely on the basis of a recommendation by jane macquitty in the times. more than two weeks later, they have not processed the order, and they are not responding to messages. im concerned that i might have lost my moneyUPDATED:Dear Helenthank you for your response. i was worried because of the delay combined with the lack of response but the explanation that you provided is reasonable and now i understand why there was a delay. thanks also for the kind goodwill gesture that you made. i look forward to receiving the order as soon as the supply issue has been resolved, which, i understand, is imminent.all the best
winedirect	GB	excellent after sales service	05 October 2019	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	I’m an Australian who was organising wine from the UK to be sent to a small Greek island for when we were holidaying there.This was my first experience under the new ownership. First thing I noted was the prompt and detailed communication along the supply chain. It all went well until the order got to Greece where it slowed for some reason. I understand these things can happen when you’re dealing with transport suppliers in non mainstream locations but we were a week into our two week holiday and it still hadn’t arrived. (I ordered 3 weeks before). However, I can’t fault Wine Direct as a lady named Michelle took personal ownership and just kept following through for me until it arrived. Then after it was all done another lady named Helen delivered excellent after sales service to put things right. Well definitely use them again.
winedirect	GB	Dreadful experience	20 September 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Ordered 6 bottles weeks ago. Still not received my order- they will not answer the phone(goes straight to voice mail) and they will not reply to e mails. This is a scam.
winedirect	GB	No need for concern.	07 June 2019	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	I was initially apprehensive about using Winedirect (Sussex) given the problem its predecessor had.  However, this company is now under new management.It offers a vast range of products, mostly as competitive prices, with a few downright bargains! I have placed 2 orders in May, one took a little longer than I was expecting due to one of the bottles not being in stock (I ticked no vintage substitutions, but if you're not worried about this then the wines arrive sooner!); the second arrived as expected in a matter of days.They also have manned telephone lines which actually get answered!Overall, I would recommend and will no doubt be buying from the rebadged Winedirect in the near future!
winedirect	GB	Wine Direct Saved Christmas	23 December 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	The wine I ordered for Christmas was held in customs (until January!). Helen found a substitute and arranged that to be delivered instead. It was a superior wine at no extra cost. Delivery was prompt and the wine delicious. Happy to heartily recommend for superb customer service!
winedirect	GB	Wine Direct (Sussex) Ltd, fantastic customer service	11 August 2020	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Wine Direct (Sussex) Ltd, and Helen in particular, were extremely helpful in helping me with an order of a particular favourite wine. The wine wasn't in the UK at the time of placing the order, but within days of a conversation, the wine was delivered to my door.I'm very impressed with their customer service and will be ordering all my wine from you from now on.Thank you.
winedirect	GB	A wine lovers company...	06 December 2019	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	This company is a pleasure to deal with. The team is great and want to help you to enjoy good wine. The selection available is remarkable and the value is good. The transition from the long established, and wonderful, business at Hailsham Cellars has gone well. We urge our best friends to use them...
winedirect	GB	Great wine and customer service	14 March 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Wine Direct has a brilliant selection of premium wines.  I received quick and helpful responses to a couple of queries I’d had prior to ordering.  Will definitely shop here again.
winedirect	GB	Efficient and friendly service	04 August 2020	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I had a very pleasant experience ordering wine from Wine Direct.A professional, efficient and personalised service. The lady I spoke to on the phone was polite and quickly alerted me when my delivery had been delayed (still received my order within 4 working days) and also included a small gift as a kind gesture.I'll be returning for future orders.
winedirect	GB	Highly Recommend	25 June 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I have used Wine Direct for a few months now as my local wine supplier and must comment on the service I have been given throughout my experience but particularity since James has taken over the business, the level of communication has vastly improved and gives me even more confidence that this is a business I want to continue using. Thank you Wine Direct.
winedirect	GB	Helen gave me great information and…	11 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Helen gave me great information and kept me up to date with a wine I wanted that they ordered in. Next day delivery and fair prices. Looking forward to using winedirect again.CheersFreddie
winedirect	GB	Slow and Uncommunicative	08 December 2022	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	Just to echo many of the other reviews, the selection of wines is great but the delivery times really aren't. On writing I've been waiting 11 days for my order to progress from pending, and have received a single reply from customer service telling me it would ship in 48 hours. That was 4 days ago.I would say if you're ordering wine to stock up, they might be good, if you want it for something specific, don't bother.
winedirect	GB	Tired of waiting.....I may expect too much	11 August 2022	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	I may expect too much, but in this day and age of internet shopping, the delivery service from Wine Direct is lethargic at best, awful if you have bought from other internet sellers. Too long to wait. Prices were OK but if you want wine for a special occasion manage your expectations from this company. It takes longer than you would expect.
winedirect	GB	Go to PayPal/credit card provider now	22 August 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Same as everyone else really. Wine order mid July, had one email and phone response making promises which were not kept, then no responses at all. Raised a case through PayPal this morning and my money has been refunded immediately. I advise anyone in a similar position to do the same.
winedirect	GB	Do Not Order from this company	22 August 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I seem to have a similar experience.  Ordered wine in April which was part delivered/damaged - then agreed to have rest of ordered delivered but have heard nothing since.  No emails or phone answered.  I have bought from the company for several years but understand it is in new ownership.  My suggestion is do not use the company.  I will be contacting my credit card company to seek refund
winedirect	US	If I could leave 0 star I would	08 September 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	If I could leave 0 star I would.  Ordered 6 bottles to be delivered as a gift and they never got shipped.  Never picked up the phone to answer my calls and never responded to any emails over the course of a 6 week period.  Avoid this group at all costs.
winedirect	GB	Wine purcahsed through Wine Direct.	28 June 2020	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	The year of the wine I ordered was no longer available, but Wine Direct immediately called me offering an excellent alternative at no surcharge. The delivery was made within days of placing the order on line.  I have found Wine Direct very professional and efficient in all their dealings.
winedirect	GB	DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY	09 August 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	"My experience is identical to all the other genuine reviews. I placed an order (7th August), was charged for the order (8th August), Order confirmed and in status ""pending"", and then nothing. Several times I have contacted them via e-mail. No response. Phone number just rings through to an answering machine. I should use TrustPilot more often to check out before buying from new (to me) companies."
winedirect	GB	Would not use this company again!	28 August 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I ordered 12 bottles of mixed wines early in July, around £390.00, heard nothing other than the order was received. After a few weeks I tried calling them and left 2 voicemails, never managed to actually speak to anyone and they never returned my calls. I also emailed them 3 times asking for an update, and have not yet received a response. Fortunately I used Paypal to make the purchase, and I approached them to see what they could do seeing as I was receiving no responses whatsoever from Wine Direct. This was escalated to a 'claim' a week or so ago, and I received an email from Paypal yesterday advising that a full refund is going to be made. I gave the new incarnation of Wine Direct the benefit of the doubt, having lost an order of around £150 or so a few years ago when the original company went down the drain. Wouldn't touch them again with a bargepole!
winedirect	GB	Greatly improved under new ownership	27 June 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Despite previous negative reviews, Wine Direct, under the new ownership of James, has successfully undergone a remarkable transformation. I was initially skeptical due to the negative feedback since my previous orders with the business, but I'm happy to say that those reviews do not reflect the business today. James has brought about significant improvements, and his passion and expertise shine through in the carefully curated selection of wines. I was particularly impressed with his recommendations of various Chablis wines, showcasing his keen eye for quality and uniqueness.Placing an order with Wine Direct was a seamless experience, and the option to track my shipment added convenience and peace of mind. It's clear that James has worked hard to create a positive and enjoyable wine buying experience. I wholeheartedly recommend giving Wine Direct a chance, as the negative reviews no longer hold true. Discover the transformed Wine Direct under James' ownership – you won't be disappointed!
winedirect	GB	Do they sell wine	11 August 2022	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	I attempted to buy some wine in the sale but my card payment failed several times so I emailed and got a response from Michelle who asked which wines I was interested in.I replied with my list but no response after several days.Strange.Maybe they don’t own the wine like another company I’ve heard about.
winedirect	GB	Highly recommended!	27 June 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	5star service from the new owners, fast delivery and a great selection of wine. I would highly recommend this company for quality/selection and customer service.
winedirect	GB	Excellent Service	12 June 2020	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I have received all 6 of my orders without any problems at all.  I am impressed with both the quality of the wine and the delivery times.  I would not hesitate to recommend this company.
winedirect	GB	An issue and communication from HQ	24 December 2019	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	Placed order for over £150 on 15th December. The total amount was taken from PayPal. 24th December 2019.Their team communicated there had been a delay in delivery, which was well received.
winedirect	GB	Outstanding service and responsiveness	20 June 2020	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Superior customer service and responsiveness, and customer friendliness. I ordered 2 x 6 bottles of a wine from South Africa. Turned out the delivery was slightly delayed due to the pandemic. Super elegant spontaneous gesture: without me asking anything, they refunded me the shipping costs! Unusual, elegant and generous. I will certainly buy from them again! Highly recommended.
winedirect	GB	Ordered wine 25th July thy took my…	14 August 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Ordered wine 25th July thy took my money now 14th August and heard nothing. Emailed them, called them and nothing. How can a company operate like this and still be trading. There is talk of it changing ownership but Companies House still Has Helen Bryant as the director. Where are you Helen Bryant??? in prison??
winedirect	GB	Didn’t receive order	04 July 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I placed an order on 4 July as a present for my friend.  The order has not been sent.  The company does not answer the phone and they have not reply to my e mails despite me getting a read receipt.  No contact/update since placing my order.  I took out a dispute with my credit card provider who have said the company has not responded to them within the given timeframe either.  My friend didn’t get my present.  Very frustrating that the company treat’s customers this way.
winedirect	GB	Exactly the same problem …	18 August 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Exactly the same problem as everyone else. Placed an order in late April. Spoke to a real person once or twice who promised delivery. Have been leaving virtually daily messages as no one ever picks up the phone! Do not use this company
winedirect	MY	Very friendly company, excellent service	15 June 2020	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Very friendly company with fast and personal service. I ordered a gift voucher to be delivered on a Sunday and no issues at all. They even advised how to get a 5% discount on the order.
winedirect	GB	I seem to be having the same experience…	09 August 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I seem to be having the same experience as a number of other people:  I ordered wine on 9th August, money taken from my account on 10th August but then nothing further.  I have emailed and left messages.  I will now take this up with my credit card company
winedirect	GB	I really would just like my order!!!!	29 August 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I'm sad to say my experience reflects those of others.  I placed my order on 16th June.  I then rang the company and spoke to a gentleman as i wanted to see if they could send my order as quick as possible.  It was a gift for my husbands birthday, and was two bottles of wine that we had drunk on our recent honeymoon to South Africa.  I was hopeful having spoken to him.  Sadly this was the last i ever heard.  I have sent countless emails, countless unanswered phone calls, and voicemails.  My next port of call will be to raise this with paypal, although truthfully i would just like my wine.  I can see wines direct have responded to some reviews,  so please if you are reading this can you just send out my order or give me some kind of update.  It has been over two months!!
winedirect	GB	This Company's a joke	17 August 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	This Company's a joke. Order made and paid on 17th of July, for 6 bottle of Ferrari (still haven't received package). Spoke to a lady after I left several messages, over a week ago, promised me that the package was going to be delivered middle of this week (16/17 August). Still nothing plus trying to call them several time and always answering machine. You leave them a message and they don't reply. They are a joke. I will cancel my order and will get a refund one way or another. Will never use it again
winedirect	GB	Terrible	06 September 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Terrible. No answer to the phone or email. I have a part delivered order since June. A newsletter said that ownership had changed. Avoid.
winedirect	GB	Shocking service!	18 May 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Like other commentators, I placed my order several months ago and I'm still waiting for my wine. If I manage to get through to someone there is always a new excuse why it hasn't been shipped and I have sent numerous emails, none of which have been answered. Shocking customer service! I'm beginning to wonder if I will ever receive my order!
winedirect	GB	No customer service	24 August 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Ordered wine over 4 weeks ago..payment taken instantly…..no order update other than ‘pending’ on site.   3 phone calls with no response …now getting a refund. Never again
winedirect	GB	Greatly improved	05 June 2019	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Greatly improved, ordered a few hard to find wines once i found out the company was under new ownership and it arrived within the week!
winedirect	GB	Great service!	04 July 2019	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	A great, varied selection of wines and the knowledgable staff were really helpful in making suggestions. I will definitely use again and would recommend to others too!
winedirect	GB	Update	19 August 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Well, after my last review I received a phone call within 12 hours. I was told my order was being assembled and would be dispatched within 24 hours. It has arrived today, albeit with substitutions due to unavailability. So after a rather protracted process I am satisfied. I would however advise Wine Direct to improve their efficiency and above all to improve their communication with customers.
winedirect	NZ	From New Zealand with Love!	31 December 2020	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	The personal service afforded me by Helen from my initial enquiry through to delivery and beyond has been exceptional. I’m in New Zealand and wanted to send a small order of NZ wine to my brother and S-i-L in Eastleigh UK to arrive before Christmas. I also cheekily asked if they could include an additional gift of NZ chocolate and a personal note from me. Not only did Helen readily agree but went out of her way to source product links from which I could choose. My original choice arrived at Wine Direct unfit for consumption. Helen then found suitable alternatives and the wine and chocolate was duly delivered to the surprise and delight of my family a few days before Christmas. For me the whole process couldn’t have been simpler, while Helen did all the running around for me!The entire experience from my initial enquiry through to the excellent courier delivery service was personal, professional and stress free. I highly recommend Wine Direct without hesitation for their excellent personal service along with their extensive array of quality wine. I will most certainly be recommending them to friends and family here in NZ and overseas and will happily use them again.
winedirect	GB	Very poor customer service	31 July 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Very poor customer service, calls and emails not  answered or follow ups actioned. Order now outstanding since January, it was part shipped in February however ~ £100 of wine still outstanding. Despite promises of different wines being shipped or refund nothing has been forthcoming. Do not use this company for buying wine, they are shockingly bad
winedirect	NL	I have to write a review because this…	17 April 2020	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I have to write a review because this is the first time I have noticed there is a review opportunity on the site.  This is because I generally don't use the site because I know what I want and call my order in.  I must have been using the company in one form or another for twenty years plus.  Steve and the team run a truly fine vintners and have always been courteous, knowledgeable and have often gone to considerable lengths to secure obscure wines for me.  Prices are competitive and the service impeccable, always arriving at my door on or before the day and time quoted.  The 'Fraud' review made me belly laugh.  I wonder if the person placing that review is cognisant of the laws of defamation and liable?  I can say I have complete trust in Wine Direct Sussex.  I have, occasionally, bought expensive wine from Waitrose cellars as well and on two occasions have had different vintages supplied other than those ordered.  They have a clever small print get out stating that this can happen.  This never happens with WDS and if a vintage is out of stock I always receive a phone call asking what I want to do, I am never just dumped with what happens to be available.  I have emailed Waitrose about this, I didn't receive a response, I don't order wine from Waitrose anymore.  Even in these most challenging of times the team at WDS are working hard to fulfil customers orders and I thank them for that.  Here's to another twenty plus years, thank you all.
winedirect	GB	Money taken but no delivery no response - poor customer service :-(	10 August 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I have ordered my wine on 10th August and despite of my email I received neither the wine nor an answer.How disappointing - people work hard for the money and this company seems not to bother :-(
winedirect	NZ	Ordered wine as a birthday present	09 August 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	So wish I had read the reviews first!! Ordered wine as a birthday present - didnt arrive, company didnt respond to emails, phone calls go straight through to voicemail.  They were super quick in taking my payment I might add but still no wine received.  Will never use again.
winedirect	GB	DISHONEST PROMISES	14 July 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Order placed 25th March 2023 part delivered but a case of David & Nadia Chenin Blanc has never been delivered. Our card was debited in full and we have been chasing Wine Direct ever since for the £305.52 they owe us. Promised full refund several times by Helen, Steve, Peter, Anita but none of them fulfilled on their seemingly very sincere promises. We will never use this company again
winedirect	GB	DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY.	04 August 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY.Wine ordered 19 May, didn't arrive, emails unanswered then finally got through by phone on 26 Jun, promised wine by end of that week but still waiting and emails and phone calls unanswered.
winedirect	GB	Oh dear	15 July 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Oh dearNot very good but maybe this review will prompt a response so WD can redeem them selves with a second more positive review from me.My sister who lives in New Zealand bought us a wine gift as a wedding present but it has never arrived at our Kent abode and all attempts to chase it up by phone or email has come to nothing . So disappointing and judging by the reviews not un-typical.Guys, get yourself together and treat you customers with the respect they deserve.
winedirect	GB	I buy a lot of wine from many suppliers…	16 February 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I buy a lot of wine from many suppliers for my business and Wine Direct Sussex is the only one I've encountered in nearly 20 years which has not followed through on an order placed six months ago and I can't get hold of anyone to discuss the problem. It's like they don't exist.  Luckily it was 'only' about £250 lost. This company is a scam, do not take the risk of buying wine from them, there are plenty of other retailers you can go to.
winedirect	GB	Do not buy from these - they're either crooks or incompetent and neither is acceptable when there's so many good choices	21 July 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Do not buy from - a big con. No wine, no correspondence and owed £175!!!Gone to Trading Standards (CAB) and now just sent a letter re: breach of Consumer Rights Act 2015 and am also challenging my payment via PayPal.  Not happy
winedirect	GB	Great service and really helpful	21 January 2020	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Great service and really helpful. The lady that called me was very helpful and friendly and couldn't have been more accommodating.
winedirect	GB	Good service great prices	20 June 2019	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I never had any dealings with the previous owners of the business , so cannot comment on previous issues, but have had prior dealings with the new owners before they took over.Glad to say the service and range of wines has been retained so I am glad to continue my relationship with the new owners and will definitely be using them again
winedirect	GB	10 weeks later and no wine & no reply to emails	28 July 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Update: raised a dispute with PayPal and they have refunded us in excess of £200 for the order that wasn't honoured.   I placed an order in mid May, well surprise surprise, it still hasnt been delivered and nor has the company bothered to send any updates nor respond to emails.  As others have said - AVOID.  I wish I had seen these reviews before I  placed my order
winedirect	GB	Excellent	13 May 2019	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Placed an order on the 8th May for a birthday gift, Wine received Friday 10th May, packaged well , courier left where stated, excellent service would definitely use again.
winedirect	GB	Let down	19 July 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Much like all the recent reviews below, I have had the exact same experience. My mother placed an order 26th May for the wine to arrive on my birthday, after many calls I kept being reassured by a friendly lady that was a matter of days away they were just awaiting customs clearance on one bottle. Needless to say I'm still waiting and now my emails bounce back and the office is closed for refurbishment.Hopefully they arrive before Christmas, or at least my next birthday!
winedirect	GB	Simply one of the best wine companies…	14 March 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Simply one of the best wine companies in the world. Superb products, competitive prices and outstanding service.
winedirect	GB	Unable to obtain delivery date/update	24 July 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I have just seen the reviews after trying to chase my order - money has been taken but I cannot speak to anyone (left a message) and emails have bounced back. Hopefully Wine Direct will read this and respond … (order ending 997!).  Will not be ordering again, safe to say!
winedirect	PT	Has changed! A LOT!!!!!!	27 September 2019	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	As many others here, I dealt with the previous owners (I did receive my order then, but after way too much time and with very poor communication) and I have to say these new ones have NOTHING to do with that level of service.I'm not an easy customer when it comes to wine. I don't want vintage nor wine changes! I research thoroughly wine by wine, vintage by vintage before buying. That being said I've ordered a mixed case from them and asked (long shot) if they didn't have a superior reference from Errazuriz state (which they had some other references).They searched, bought it and then sold it to me for a very (VERY!!!) good price. We are talking about a wine that is really hard to find and they found me 6 bottles of it underpriced!Ended up buying 18 bottles of wine. Already opened 3 and all were in good condition.Had some problems with the delivery. Chronopost broke a bottle somewhere along the way and as any other carrier their customer service is...0! Had to again get in contact with winedirect whom again solved the problem. Wine went back to them and sent through other carrier (TNT) which was average service.Never during all the time that the order took I felt like they didn't care. Always got response for the emails on time. The only thing I would advise is (since everything is much better) to change the website which is a bit dated.But as long as the price/quality ratio mantains these standards I'm more than happy to buy from them.
winedirect	GB	Always excellent service	08 March 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Always excellent service, great wines and competitive pricing. Have been using Wine Direct for years and cant recommend them more!
winedirect	CA	The site is a total scam	18 March 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	The site is a total scam. They don't have the wine.Look at the real 1 star reviews. Don't be fooled by the other fake reviews. DO NOT USE THIS SITE.As per the reply, I did get a refund but only after I got American Express involved. ALL of my prior communications had been ignored.
winedirect	GB	Avoid like the plague	18 July 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Placed an order 2 months ago. Called to complain after a month, and received reassurances that the order would be with me within a week, that the delivery charge would be credited and they would add another bottle to say sorry. Two months on, nothing has happened, and when called (several times), I could not get through. Sent emails but received no answers. Had to report them to my credit card company to get a refund.Stay away, avoid like the plague.
winedirect	GB	Do not buy from this company	17 August 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Do not buy from this company! I so wish I had read the reviews before I bought. Taken my money but no goods received after 3 weeks. No communication from them. They dont answer the phone and dont reply to emails. They are either totally incompetent or crooks

winedirect	GB	Avoid like the plague	15 July 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Having used this company before and had good service, I now unfortunately think this is/has become a scam. I ordered a case of wine on 23rd May for a birthday in July - contacted them at the end of June and was reassured it would be with me within days due to import difficulties. Having chased them again the office is now closed for 10 days and the email addresses for Sales and Support bounce back - this all smacks of a scam and I'm left with no alternative but to contact my bank to chase down the funds.  I would urge anyone to avoid ordering from this company.
winedirect	GB	DO NOT BUY	18 May 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	DO NOT BUYFrom this company or winedirect.co.uk - the same business - they will repeatedly lie about status of wine and promise refund when it doesn’t arrive and then ignore you.  I have now taken legal action for money back.
winedirect	US	Avoid at all costs	26 July 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I placed and paid for an order of 18 bottles of wine. After two weeks of hearing absolutely nothing, I rang to enquire what was going on. The gentleman said he had 5 bottles in, would I like them for the weekend (it was a Tuesday). The 5 bottles arrived on the Monday. Four weeks later, having still had absolutely zero communication from the company about the order status, I rang again and the lady gave me a story about new ownership, that they had 10 of the remaining bottles and were waiting for the other 3 which were guaranteed to be in in 3 days' time. A further two weeks later, still hearing nothing - no offer of the bottles they had in stock, no apology, no update of any sort - I rang yet again but to request cancellation and refund. A somewhat bothered lady , Helen, was nonplussed about the situation and simply assured me the refund would be processed. I only wish I had looked them up on here before being wooed by their clearly nonexistent wine selection.
winedirect	GB	Good service and quick delivery	06 May 2020	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Good service and quick delivery given everything going on. I'll definitely use again.
winedirect	GB	Partial Order	18 July 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Like several others who have reviewed Wine Direct, I have received half of my order (though I was not told it was only a partial order until after it had arrived). Since then, nothing. I have emailed them twice: no reply to the first email, and the second one has bounced.
winedirect	GB	Scammers	15 June 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Ordered 4 bottles of wine 3 months ago. Emailed 3 times and left 2 voice mails. Absolutely mental that a company like this exists and is continuing to trade and get away with this negligence. Trading standards will be notified on Friday if there is no reply.
winedirect	GB	AVOID- if only I'd checked Trustpilot	19 June 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Same story as below- not responding to emails and no wine delivered.I'll be contacting Justerini and Brooks too as they will be suffering brand damage by association with these scam artists.I'll have to make a chargeback on the debit card
winedirect	GB	Well done Wine Direct (Sussex) Ltd!	18 May 2019	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	My order was delivered to my door in record time and the wine is excellent! Thank you so much to the new owners. We'll be back for more!
winedirect	GB	Giving one star as there is no option…	20 July 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	"Giving one star as there is no option to leave none. I also placed an order in late May in good time for an event in late July. No delivery despite me having chased them several times and been given definite dates for dispatch. I eventually spoke to a helpful lady who arranged for part of the order to be shipped and assured me that she would chase up the wine which was ""held up due to import issues"".  Having heard no more, I telphoned on Monday 17th July. There is a recorded message saying that the office & warehouse is closed for refurbishment and that they will open again on 24th July. No facility to leave a message. However, they are ""monitoring emails"" .  I have emailed every day this week, to every possible email address and each time my emails bounce back.  I now strongly suspect that this company has ceased trading and will take the issue up with my Credit Card issuer.  DO NOT ORDER from this company!"
winedirect	GB	Not to trusted when you need it for a special occasion	27 January 2021	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	They took the money for the order even that they didn’t had it in stock and never bothered to call or email me. If you want to buy for a special occasion they are not to be trust.

winedirect	GB	Don’t use this company. You have been warned.	23 August 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I gave them 1 Star because you can’t give them none. They probably deserve minus. Same issue as many others. Ordered wine, paid for it. Now can’t get hold of them by phone or email. Phone goes to answer machine. Did get through once and was told they can’t retrieve messages and are awaiting a delivery to clear customs. My wine would be with by last Monday. Ha! Don’t touch them with a barge pole. They are selling wine they don’t have and they lie to you.You have been warned. In hands of my credit card company. I see this as theft and will be taking any action I can. Buy wine from some body else.
winedirect	GB	Would buy from them again	21 June 2023	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	I don’t tend to leave reviews, and thought I would leave one as people seem to have had bad experiences, which I haven’t, my order was sent a couple of days late, but I expected this as I believe it was difficult to source, it arrived nicely packaged and I will give the company the benefit of the doubt and order with them in the future.

I couldn't recommend Wine Direct more highly.
winedirect	GB	Appalling company. Stolen my money and ran.	21 June 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	"Usually I read trustpilot before buying from a new website but this time I didn't. I damn wish I had now.Waited a month for my order and just like every other customer on here, I haven't received it. The order has been ""pending"" for 4 weeks. Emailed this morning and a few hours later checked trust pilot, and surprise surprise, I'm not the only one to have this happen.It is absolutely criminal what this company has done. Stupidly I paid by debit card so I probably won't be seeing that money again, and quite frankly, a ""15% sorry discount"" from the people who have taken over the shambles of a company is not enough. Absolutely appalling."
winedirect	HK	Should they still be in business? Beware......	17 May 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I placed an order for Pnds 2500 and not received the goods. I requested a refund and they agreed but two months afrer the original transaction have not received anything. Not answering phone or replying to email.After posting this and contacting my credit card company I did get a call and they have made a full refund. But frankly all too much trouble. Other wine companies I use actually have a customer servive attitude that sorts out issues in hours (not weeks) and compensates appropriately.
winedirect	GB	Poor service	02 July 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Placed order on 2 July and still not received wine and no reply to e-mails. I would not have ordered from this company had I known the service was so poor. Tried to ring today with a message saying the warehouse is closed til 24 July so who knows when I’ll receive my order if at all.
winedirect	GB	Nearly 4 weeks to delivery a single…	08 July 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Nearly 4 weeks to delivery a single bottle of wine as a present. Needless to say the special date was missed. There is a very nice lady on the phone who I had to call 6 times as there were no updates. The wine was always coming in soon and would be delivered shortly. Why sell something you don’t have? The whole thing was long and frustrating and I wouldn’t repeat the experience by using this firm again.
winedirect	CA	This company don't deliver	07 May 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	This company don't deliver. There is no communication with the customer. You order. They take your money straight away. Then nothing. Hard to chase up as it's mainly no response to calls or email. I had to get my bank to claim the money back.An alternative company delivered the same product the next day.
winedirect	GB	Over Two Weeks Later - Still No Update or Goods	04 June 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I placed an order on the 4th of June 2023. Aside from an acknowledgement email, plus another one two hours later on the same day telling me the order status had been changed to 'pending', I've received no other responses to my emails or phone calls for over two weeks now.The reason for my order was a special day that has now already happened.Very disappointed. Things seem to be getting worse with this company.However, I'm glad I made the purchase on my credit card as they were very helpful in providing me with a refund.I would always recommend people use a credit card for purchases but in this case use nothing at all and stay away from this company.
winedirect	GB	DO NOT BUY WINE FROM THIS COMPANY!	26 May 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Ordered wine that was offered on their website on 12 April 2023 and it is now the end of May and nothing has arrived. No messages, no compensatory gestures, nothing!  I have now formally requested a refund. Quite the most dreadful wine company I have had the misfortune to deal with, I will NEVER buy from them again and advise you to avoid them like the plague. Like many other reviewers on here. don't say I didn't warn you!
winedirect	GB	I won't be using them again	04 February 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Like the more recent reviews, a great stock list but super slow delivery and very poor communication.  I ordered a month ago and recieved 5 of 12 bottles about 2 weeks later.  I got a reply to a follow up e-mail saying the remaining were stuck in customs but would arrive last week.  One further e-mail was ignored, the phone went straight to voicemail.  Another e-mail got exactly the same reply as the first - so now trying to get a refund which given their comms could take a while.
winedirect	GB	Do not buy wine from this company	18 April 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Do not buy wine from this company. I ordered wine for delivery for that weekend for a party but it wasn't delivered so I contacted them asking where it was and saying I'd like to cancel if it wasn't available as wanted it for that weekend.  I didn't receive an answer and have since emailed 4 times and called 3 times with no answer/ response. This is now over 6 weeks.  I have now said that I will claim the payment via the small claims court.  Please note that payment was taken immediately !!!

They don't answer the phone asking you to leave a message, they don't respond to emails either. 21/3/23 An update, got through on the phone.  Very helpful lady offered to contact the distributor and have the wine sent directly to my daughter rather than to them first for onward distribution.  Arrived 22/3/23 at long last.....

winedirect	GB	This company appears to be a scam	28 April 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Ordered on the 28th April, it’s now the 14th May. The order still shows ‘pending’. No communication whatsoever since then. The phone line just goes to a message advising that you can’t leave a message. No response via email. I just noticed that while I ordered 12 bottles, the status only shows 6 items - what happened to the other bottles they charged £235 for? This company appears to be a scam.

The order was dispatched (Parcelforce) on the 18th, but the delivery was a package of 3 bottles.No reply has been forthcoming to any of the numerous contact attempts via telephone or email to seek information.Very disappointed.

I have spoken to customer services on a couple of occasions and been assured that my wine would be arriving shortly, the last time I spoke with them was 4 weeks ago, I was told my wine was in the UK and had cleared customs...still no wine and I am now unable to contact them. No one answers the telephone, I have left voicemail messages, no one has got back to me and I have sent emails and no one has replied. I am beginning to wonder if this company has shut down.They have had my money since March, I have been extremely patient, however now my patience has run dry and the fact that no one is communicating with me and I cannot get in touch with the company is just making matters worse.I will NEVER use them again, and suggest you avoid at all costs.APPALLING SERVICE

winedirect	GB	Poor Customer Service	05 May 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I've used Wine Direct since 2012 and generally found them good. Unfortunately, and based on other reviews, they seem to have problems. Problems that may be beyond their control but they don't reply, so I don't know.I ordered 6 bottles in Feb. and received 5. I was told the 6th was stuck in transport and should be with me soon. Over 8-weeks later, no word. I have mailed and called several times but no replies. It is a shame but I will never use them again out of principle.I'd suggest you seek wine from more reliable firms.
winedirect	GB	Disappointing lack of customer service	14 June 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Unfortunately, I have had a similar experience to other reviewers. I placed an order mid-June, and my account changed to 'pending' the following day. After no further updates for a couple of weeks, and no response to my emails requesting an update, I rang them, and actually managed to speak to someone who told me that my order was held up in customs and was scheduled for delivery the following week. Perfectly plausible. She also claimed that they were having email problems, and hadn't received my enquiries. However, another two weeks on, I've still heard nothing and can get no response from email, telephone or via the Facebook page. I am, however, getting regular marketing emails! I see from responses to other reviews that someone is responding and that there is new management, and can only hope my order will eventually be sorted out. I quite understand that it can take time for an order to arrive - it's the complete lack of communication that is really disappointing, and worrying considering some of the other reviews.
winedirect	GB	No correspondence despite taking money	19 January 2019	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I am afraid I have called this company over 20 times to try and actually speak to somebody regarding my order. No answer. No answer to my emails or chat message requests. No indication as to delivery. They had a minimum order of 6 bottles which came into well over 100 pounds. The next step is calling my bank and getting my money refunded. Worse company I’ve had to deal with in U.K.. I won’t order from them again!.

Daylight robbery is what it is! Absolutely awful awful company and I will NEVER use them again and will be advising every one I know to stay clear also. I am sad for my husbands old company as they have lost their money - shocking!!
winedirect	GB	Ordered wine 2nd April 47 days later still no wine.	17 May 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Ordered wine 2nd April for expected delivery on circa the 5th April as this was in stock, noted order pending had not changed so emailed again on the 5th April. Order never arrived. Emailed for an update on the 11th April saying to cancel the order and no reply but i did have a phone call. The lady (Helen Bryant i assume) said it was out of stock and it was my fault as i should have seen this. I actually had a screen shot and there was no out of stock message.Agreed to leave it until stock came in on the 2nd May and it would be straight out to me.Here we are now the 15th May and no delivery, emailed them to say i want a refund and again no contact. Now 47 days since ordering so i have filled a complaint to the bank to reverse the transaction. If i have no joy there i will instruct a Debt Collection Agency who take no prisoners when used in the past with a 100% success rate for our company. I will be driving past their place in two weeks time so may call in for a chat with them too.

On 01/04/23 I contacted them via email to ask where my order was - no response. Phoned them to ask and was told they are very busy and would get round to contacting me. Said the wine was out of stock - they didn’t say that when I placed the order. I was told they were expecting it that week and it should be despatched and received Easter Saturday (8 April).It is now 19/04/23 and I’ve heard nothing. No email, no phone call, no apology. The order still says pending. What a shambles. I hope Wine Direct read their reviews and get their backsides into motion. If you give poor service, you don’t get repeat custom and your business won’t survive. Is this business poorly managed or is it a scam?  I definitely don’t recommend this business.19/95/23 update - still no communication, or wine received.  Can’t get through on the phone.  Now I’ve referred it to my credit card company.

winedirect	GB	Very poor communication and let down by the company	19 December 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Ordered 4 wines for Christmas at beginning of December - and money taken (of course). Only when received invoice did I see the statements, replace or different vintage. These wines were on a list my husband gave so not replacements would do. I emailed and this was acknowledged. Chased delivery 2 x by email - no response. Called on 19th to be told the most important wine was out of stock but the order was ready to be sent with a replacement! The wine I wanted wasn't due in until the new year and no date. I had also ordered a personalised wine box to put these wines in that is obviously non returnable. I had to cancel the wine order and now have an empty personalised box.  The staff are good when you speak to them but really the website needs real improvement if this company are to survive in a  crowded market place in poor economic times. Those with the best service will survive. Just tell us if its out of stick and keep customers informed if you want to keep them. Now waiting for a full refund - 5 days later nothing so how long????
winedirect	GB	If only I'd checked out Wine Direct on Trustpilot first!	25 January 2019	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	"I unwittingly stumbled into this hapless (and seemingly dishonest) company a week ago. On 17 January 2019, I was searching for a case of particular wine via Google, and the ""Just-in-Cases/Wine Direct"" web sites came up showing it in stock. I went ahead and placed an order, and paid (thankfully) by MasterCard. I only wish that I had checked them out on Trustpilot before doing so. Like other victims, the money was taken, but no order acknowledgement was forthcoming. I tried phoning them the next day, but like others, could not speak to anybody. No response to messages left on their voicemail, or to email. The web site was closed down over the weekend (apparently undergoing maintenance!!). I began to suspect that the company had gone bust. This was confirmed when the web site came back up again on 25 January, displaying a statement by administrators. They had indeed ceased trading.The matter of compensation is now in the hands of the credit card company.Further update on 13 Feb 2019:Pleased to say that my Credit Card company has made a full refund to my account."

winedirect	GB	I ordered my wine on the 16th of…	06 January 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I ordered my wine on the 16th of December to be delivered for Christmas to Republic of Ireland. I received an email on the 21st saying it was ‘Packed’ which supposedly means Dispatched on their American system.The non delivery for Christmas was attributed to the closure of border for 48hrs. So far understandable. It is the 6th now and the wine still hasn’t been delivered. After I wrote my second email of complaint I received a response stating that they recalled all the deliveries from DPd and re sent  them and that is why the date of despatch they mentioned and the dispatch dates on DPd website were different. I would love to believe this but cannot understand why when I called on the 29th evening I wasn’t given this info.. Also there was no update given at all except for a generic missive on their website.Anyway whatever the reason for the delay this is the first and last time I use this firm. I really should have read the reviews before I ordered from them especially since these were gifts for in-laws we couldn’t see due to the travel  restrictions

winedirect	GB	You make a order but nothing arrives	07 August 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	the problem with this company that I encountered was that you make a online order and had to wait ages for it to arrive, which includes several unanswered phone calls, frankly I'm going to avoid making any more orders with this company as there are so many companies out there who offer a far better service than this one, shame......
winedirect	GB	No service or support at all	02 January 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	UPDATE to below review:Later that day after my review was posted, I received a call from a lady at Wine Directs, offering her sincere apologies. She could not understand why I had been waiting so long for my wine, why no messages had been returned and agreed it was not good enough. She offered to email me her personal number / email address for future contact if I needed it (although to date I have not yet received this) and promised to ship out the wine, albeit with substitutions of similar / greater value. I am relieved to say the next day, my missing 7 bottles of wine finally turned up. It doesn't really compensate for the 4 months delay of my wine, nor explain any reasons, but I am pleased to have got my wine and I appreciated the phone call and apology.---------------------------------No service or support, they do not respond to emails, messages or phone calls. Zero customer service which I rarely experience. Ordered £550 of wine January 2nd, partly delivered 4 weeks later, still awaiting remaining 6 bottles but they will not respond to my queries about when I can expect to receive them. They just ignore me and it is so frustrating. I have had to instigate a charge back claim through my credit card as they must be in breach of some contract and have had my money for almost 4 months and I have not had my wine, I am not sure I ever will! They purport to offer a great variety of wine and I do like their choices but when they cannot deliver on what they offer with absolutely no communication then I cannot trust them anymore. Shame, but very unusually for me I would say do not use them, with regret!

winedirect	GB	AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE	10 June 2019	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUEI find it disconcerting that this company has reappeared selling the same product, using the same web site URI, using the same web site frontend and backend software and images. It's interesting too that - like it's previous instance - these people are not responding to polite emails about missing wine (7 days later).What's better is that they even have my personal data on their database including the order that I made that they - sorry the previous owners - so earnestly promised but which they never delivered to me. So what has changed you might ask?Well all that I can see is that we now have (Sussex) rather than troublesome things like International or any such nonsense in the company name on Company House. Oh and there's the teeny, tiny problem that the wine that I bought for £100+ is no longer owed to me by this 'new' company even thought they have the order on their system. How nice for them?Assuming that I am not unique amongst winedirect's thousands of customers - except for the fact that I work with GDPR for a living - I will take it as my social responsibility to ask the ICO about their views on the large scale transfer and processing of peoples' personal data without transparency, consent or other lawful basis to do so. Penalties are max Euro 20M in addition to any damages that individuals raise separately. p.s. Note to the 'new' owners: I'm a mistrusting soul - being left short £100+ on an order does that to you. So I have taken evidence of my claims prior to posting this review. And given that you have been publicly informed of my intention to complain to the ICO you would now delete that data at your peril. But, of course, you might consider that a risk that you are willing to take and hope to get away with that too.

I ordered on 21st November 2018, money taken same day, and I still haven’t received my order. My emails are ignored, Messages on their online contact form asking for updates also go ignored. If you call you only ever get an answer machine, I leave messages but never get a reply.PLEASE if anyone has similar experiences PLEASE report to Citizens Advice, they will pass claims to Trading Standards, surely if enough claims these thieves will be investigated and shut down. This company is part of the Fermentation group who own justincases.co.uk so AVOID that company too!
winedirect	NZ	Christmas present delivered 10 Jan	11 January 2019	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	We ordered on 16 Dec for a Christmas present after checking delivery times etc.  It was finally delivered 10 Jan.  In the interim I had rung multiple times (incurring int. Call costs) during posted business hours and they were always on answer phone. I left messages including order no. Saying please cancel order and refund. I also sent email through their website. My son in London also tried ringing multiple times with same result.  Will NEVER use again!
winedirect	AU	The wine I ordered and paid for on…	11 January 2019	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	The wine I ordered and paid for on 12.12.18 for my UK family’s Xmas finally arrived on 28.12.18. Too late - missed the event, family dispersed.  They delivered 6 extra bottles  - perhaps as compensation for their failure to deliver my order on time, or perhaps a mistake - we will never know because there was no note, no reply to my 4 emails, 3 website chat requests and 6 phone messages inquiring about my order.  So I’m not surprised to read some of the reviews posted in the past few days by other customers left in the lurch - it really did feel like the company was only partially functioning.  Absolutely hopeless.  Never again.
winedirect	GB	Liquidated !	10 January 2019	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I have used Wine Direct before and this is the first time I have had a problem. My account says the wine was delivered in October when they said it would after November 5th. Since yesterday my previous orders have been wiped clean !
winedirect	GB	Avoid	10 January 2019	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	AvoidPlaced an order on 18 December and the money (£200+) was debited from my account on 19 December. Despite numerous phone calls, emails and attempts to online chat with the company, I received no response.  Thankfully the bank refunded me and are chasing the company for the money, despite paying on my debit card. Clearly this company have no intention of honouring orders. For anyone experiencing similar problems - Fermentation Limited is the company and is still showing as 'Active' on Companies House. You should be able to get your money back through your bank (depending on how you paid and specific bank's policy) by marking the transaction as disputed.

winedirect	GB	Has Wine Direct gone bust? They don't answer phone any more	09 January 2019	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Similar to the below review, we ordered wine from Wine Direct before Xmas (Dec 17th) no sign of it to this day (Jan 9th) they do not answer their phone, do not respond to emails, looks like we will have to take them to small claims court to get the money back. Do not order from them I think they must have gone bust ...
winedirect	GB	Regular customer who sadly will never use them again. DO NOT USE	08 January 2019	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Having used wine direct for a number of years i have always found them to be very prompt and also incredibly helpful when i called up. However something has happened to this company. Having ordered a number of wines in November there was no sign of delivery. No one answers the phone or replies to emails. Horrendous service. I engaged my credit card company to reclaim the money spent. Much to my surprise the wine then turned up! However having selected no wine substitutions they decided to swap a £70 bottle of red wine for a £35 bottle of white wine. I have since called numerous times to get the money refunded but low and behold no replies. I have essentially paid double for a bottle of wine i had no interest in buying. I am actually very sad to say I will never use them again and urge others not to use them. Something has happened to this previously nice and reliable company. Do not use.
winedirect	AU	Great selection of wines on offer	08 January 2019	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	Great selection of wines on offer. We are based in Australia and needed to send Xmas wines to our clients in UK/Europe, and we had a specific brand we needed to send. WineDirect had it, however, I had to place another order later in the week, and the wines we were sending, then needed a minimum purchase of 6 bottles, as opposed to the single bottles I had previously ordered. This was a problem, so we needed to find an alternative online seller to send other wines/champagnes. Otherwise a great service.
winedirect	GB	Poor service!	07 January 2019	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	I placed an order with WineDirect on the 22nd December and finally received my order on the 5th Jan. I called them four times and emailed twice but literally had no response whatsoever! I was trying to ascertain when I would expect my order as I had heard nothing. Even when it was shipped they did not inform me. Therefore, I missed the delivery date/time and finally picked it up on the 7th Jan.

winedirect	GB	Megan	04 January 2019	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	The wine that I ordered was delivered a couple of hours ago, in full with no substitutions.   To be fair it was also cheaper than the same wine on different websites.On the other hand it did not arrive in time for Christmas and I couldn't get any response from their website despite several emails and phone calls. In my last message to them I asked them to reply or I would have no choice but to contact Trading standards.Again I heard nothing but had an email from Parcel force yesterday stating that they had collected a parcel from them which would be delivered today and it was.So apart from abysmal customer service and the late arrival I don't have anything to complain about.However, their website now appears to have been shut down.  So I think I may have just been lucky.

I ordered on 12/11/2018 and finally received my 6 bottles a few days before Christmas. Chase contact was a waste of time until I selected ""sales enquiry"" instead of ""customer services"" enquiry. I then received an email advising that the bottles were being shipped. I don't hold out much hope for those who have not received anything yet- it seems to have been hit and miss."
winedirect	GB	Very poor	04 January 2019	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Very poor. Promised delivery for four separate dates, then eventually let slip that they didn't even have the wine in stock. Promised a refund but that didn't materialise either. Luckily I'd used my credit card and the card company dealt with my issue quickly. Avoid WineDirect!!!

winedirect	JP	6 weeks for delivery, no reply to contact	04 January 2019	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	A case of wine was ordered which took 6 weeks to arrive. There was no response to email or phone inquiries after order was placed. I am just grateful that the wine arrived in the end. The delivery missed the date I wanted it for which meant alternative wine needed to be sourced elsewhere. Not good enough. From some of the other reviews on here, it seems I was actually pretty lucky to receive the goods. Strong caution recommended.

They need to answer the telephone and quickly reply to emails. By not doing this their customers think the worst. It takes about 2 weeks+ to receive the wine.

Messaged the company to enquire whether order will be completed, or I will receive a refund for the 2 outstanding bottles. No response. I then received an (probably generic) email from the company, asking for feedback. This email bemoaned the company’s poor rating on Trustpilot, and implied this was not a true reflection of their company. I think their view is that only customers who have had a problem, leave a review, and the satisfied remain silent. That’s as may be, but I’m joining the majority of reviewers who rate this company as low as you can go.

winedirect	GB	Terrible - they should not be in business!	15 December 2018	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Terrible!  We bought £500 of wine for Christmas at the beginning of November.  It took a month to show up and when it did, 12 bottles of our order had been substituted with 10 bottles of poor quality wine at less than half the cost.  There was no prior communication or warning that the substitution would happen (contrary to their own T&Cs) and no refund for the difference (about £160 worth).  Nobody answers the phone (I tried redialling for 1 hour) or returns messages, no answer to emails.   Stupidly, this is the fourth time we have dealt with this company (they are the only ones that claim to source a particular wine that we like, so we are forced to go with them).  We should have known better as we have had problems with three of the transactions.  I am pursuing as a dispute trough my credit card company and hope to receive a full credit for the transaction.  I suspect they are going out of business as they have not challenged the dispute and will lose significantly for this bad business.
winedirect	GB	Keep away from this company	14 December 2018	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I just ordered £50 of wine using a gift voucher so should have just been charged £7.50 for delivery. Guess what they have debited my card by £57.50 !! They dont reply on the phone or email. Winedirect you just messed up woth the wrong guy ! Will see you in court . DONT DEAL WITH THIS COMPANY.

I have left numerous voicemails, and sent messages via their website but i am yet to hear back ANYTHING. have now asked my credit card company to dispute the payment, so lets see what comes out of that. PLEASE AVOID THIS WEBSITE, ITS A COMPLETE SHAM!
winedirect	GB	Do not order from this Company!	14 December 2018	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	It's your call but I would reiterate many aspects of others who have also critiqued this Company. Their website seems to cover everything......the money is taken immediately, the communication once the order is placed is non-existent, if you want to call / email / chat then you will be frustrated as they don't respond......you name it, it isn't great. If you do decide to carry on, pay with a credit card and have really low expectation. My advice......stay well clear and hope they cease trading as they shouldn't be in business.....sad state really.....if it were my business, I would be horrified looking at the reviews.
winedirect	GB	This company is a complete sham!	14 December 2018	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	This company is a complete sham!. Money taken immediately....wine not arrived after six weeks. They do not answer the phone or reply to emails. AVOID THIS COMPANY!

As of 13/12/18, no information on the order. They don't answer the phone or e-mails so the only thing I could do is contact my credit card provider to recover the payment. Beware, no customer service, no communication and certainly no satisfaction.
winedirect	GB	Longer lead time to deliver	13 December 2018	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	It took 9 days from order to delivery.  I think it is a bit longer if I compare to the other online wine shops, such as BBR or Lea & Sandeman etc.Packing was very solid and proper which is very good.
winedirect	GB	Great selection of wines at good prices...	13 December 2018	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	I was able to source a tricky to find bottle of wine through WineDirect at a great price, delivery was within a week and the bottle came extremely well packaged.I echo the experience of some other users, in that communication on order processing, dispatch and delivery estimates could be improved - however in my case, this didn't impact the quality of the product, price, and ability to get hold of it.On the basis of my experience, I would deal with again. Just be mindful that your experience would be improved by opting to have your order delivered to a manned address.
winedirect	GB	Poor communication of delivery details	13 December 2018	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	Ordered a 6 bottle case of Marzimino on 3rd Dec 18.There was no clear info on how long it would take, only that I would be contacted when it was to be dispatched.I received an SMS on 7th Dec to say that my wine would be delivered the next day by ParcelForce. Unfortunately I was away from my house for the next 2 nights.Whilst I am pleased with the speed of delivery and the quality of the product, I don't think that this is adequate communication from the company regards informing me of dispatch and delivery.I think that Wine Direct should give you a delivery date when you order and stick to that date AND provide regular updates on its progress.
winedirect	NZ	Avoid this company at all costs	12 December 2018	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Avoid this company. Took the money, failed to deliver the wine, refused to answer emails or respond to phone calls. I’ve used them before with no problem but this experience and the other reviews here indicate they are at best useless and possibly deliberately dishonest.

winedirect	GB	STAY FAR AWAY!	12 December 2018	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	STAY FAR AWAY!! They are total fraudsters!! Called them several times and every time it went to answer phone. No one ever returned calls. They are not a legitimate company. Thank goodness I paid for order with a mbna credit card as they are crediting my account as I have fraud protection. The only good thing is I have learned to always check on trust pilot first before ordering from a new website. If only I had read other people's experiences I would have been saved a headache in this case.

winedirect	GB	Wandering Bear Merlot	10 December 2018	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	This is a wonderful wine sold at an extremely cheap price, infact a bottle bought from the Wine Rack was cheaper than a glass of the wine bought in a London Hotel.Service was efficient and the wine was delivered well packed. Will deal with Wine Direct again.
winedirect	GB	Do not order from this website	07 December 2018	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	AS of today I have reported this company to Trading Standards they are not of any substance.

Repeated efforts to contact them have got me nowhere. I won't be ordering again.

The official name of the company is Fermentation LTD. Wine Direct is just one of their websites, a new one called Mina Wine has recently appeared. My experience is exactly the same as all the genuine reviews here. Placed order, money taken almost immediately, and then - nothing. No wine, doesn't respond to emails/messages and no one answers the phone.
winedirect	GB	Absolutely appalling service	05 December 2018	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Absolutely appalling service. I ordered 6 bottles of wine over 2 weeks ago and I still have no wine. When I first complained I was told it was arriving in 2 days and would receive an email shortly That was over 10 days and still no wine. No one answers the phone, I have had no replies to my emails or voice messages asking for a refund. Since then I have found this wine cheaper elsewhere and it arrived the next day. AVOID this company.

I ordered wine six weeks ago, as per their terms and conditions the money was deducted from my account on the same day.Since I have attempted to call numerous times. (at least 20) at various times of the day, the line is never answered and neither are the messages left.  I have also emailed on several occasions and someone called Tony replied saying he would look into it, and again I haven’t heard anything.I am now considering making a claim through the courts, they really shouldn’t be able to dupe people in this way.
winedirect	GB	Completely useless company	28 November 2018	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Completely useless company. Don't deliver and never answer the phone. Leaving messages is hopeless as you never get called back. I have now cancelled my order having waited three weeks for it. Whether I ever get a refund is looking doubtful. Avoid these jokers at all cost.

winedirect	GB	Superb service from start to finish	27 November 2018	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Superb service from start to finish. Ordering was simple, wine was exactly as ordered, shipped and delivered within 3 working days, quicker than I expected, delivery people followed my instructions and left the case where I said to leave it, all in all I couldn't fault WineDirect and will definitely use them again and would recommend them to others.
winedirect	GB	Would give zero if I could	27 November 2018	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Would give zero if I could.  As per other reviews (which I wish I'd read) their service is shocking / non existent.  They took GBP300 in payment, eventually promised delivery on a particular day, no wine arrived.  No response to subsequent emails or voicemails.Really disappointing (obviously), as we used them for our wedding and although they were a bit shabby we eventually received our wine and it was lovely.  Something has gone horribly wrong in the last 4 years.
winedirect	GB	Am really disappointed	24 November 2018	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Am really disappointed.  In spite of phone and e-mails, no response about a wine i was promised over three weeks ago.   If they have had a delay of delivery, i would accept (it happened on my previous order from them) but they should have the decency to advise.I have contacted my credit company for a refund.  It also makes me question the veracity of the reviews they post in support of sales.   James Suckling's strong review (94 pts) encouraged me to purchase wines on my previous order.  The wine tastes thin (the first two bottles of the case); an online site suggests that reviewers have given it 88-89 points so I wonder if they have posted a misleading review?  i have written to Suckling and am waiting to hear.I will now no longer buy from winedirect uk.  Poor service and questionable at all points.PS does Tony really exist?
winedirect	GB	I Would Recommend Wine Direct	23 November 2018	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Order received from WineDirect very promptly and extremely safely packaged. The wine was exactly as described in the information panel (aromatic flavours of lychee, rose petals and violets on the nose) and served as an excellent gift for my Husband who is a great fan of Gewurztraminer wines. Very pleased indeed with the online service of WineDirect and would thoroughly recommend, so I am confused by all the negative reviews; my own experience was spot on.
winedirect	GB	Another very poor experience	23 November 2018	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Another experience of very poor service. Website talks of delivery being up to 14 days. We're at 21 days with no update, and no wine. Phone rings through to answerphone. Thankfully got on credit card, so will be claiming back that way.

winedirect	GB	***AVOID**	22 November 2018	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	***AVOID**. A few different orders placed: then logged back in after a few days to see if status of order has changed; guess what?  no it hasn’t.  Then took a look on UK Companies house and found in excess of 10 shareholders for the company.  Also found that the address on the website is the old company registered address and was changed I think in May of this year.  Called customer service number at various times during the day and it rang and rang then once or twice sounded like it diverted to a mobile phone.  I see the payment provider is STRIPE based in Dublin.  I bet they have no idea they have a client accepting payments that gives little to no service.  This in my opinion is DECEPTIVE SELLING.  No problems though just make sure you contact your credit or debit card issuer and make sure you also send copies of these TRUSTPILOT REVIEWS.
winedirect	GB	Unfortunately the poor reviews are spot on	22 November 2018	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Unfortunately the poor reviews are exceptionally accurate... and probably kinder than they should be. I've used Wine Direct for a while now and the service has gotten to such a low point that I'm kicking myself I was silly enough to give them another shot. There is a very high likelihood that your order will be shipped in 3-4 weeks at best and you'll receive no communication at all during that period. I'm still waiting for mine. Phone calls always go through to VM and emails are not responded to. It's remarkable that in the age of Amazon they are still in business though I do suspect that it won't be for much longer. There are too many good operators in the market for this to continue.Please do look elsewhere, some others I can recommend include:- Great Western Wine- The Vinorium- Philgas and Swiggot- Laithewaites (yep, they do a much better job than Wine Direct)

winedirect	GB	DO NOT USE	20 November 2018	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	DO NOT USE.   I ordered two bottles of wine through them. When they didn't turn up for a week and I had had no communication I looked at reviews. I wish I had done this before I ordered!!!I eventually received two bottles of wine that were significantly cheaper than the ones I had ordered. I had said I did not want substitutes and I have not had a refund for the difference. I have tried many times to call and chat through the website but no-one every answers either. DO NOT USE - they are crooks. this company should be shut down.

winedirect	GB	Terrible company. Avoid!	16 November 2018	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Avoid! Dodgy company who will take your money and run.I used to order from Wine Direct regularly and all was fine, but then the service started to get a little sloppy with long delays for delivery so I looked elsewhere. That was a few years ago and I haven't ordered with them since then. I believe they were then owned by Hailsham Cellars but that appears to have changed.I recently ordered a few bottles of wine from them, for which they took my money, and then nothing. I emailed to get an update a week later and was told they'd look into it, and then nothing again. Many attempted phone calls and emails later and still no update. Not sure if I can get the money back but obviously I won't be using them again, ever.

winedirect	GB	DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY UNLESS YOU ARE HAPPY TO THROW MONEY AWAY	14 November 2018	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Placed an order in October and waited nearly 2 weeks with no update so chased customer service. Was told by Tony that would be delivered in a few days and I would receive a tracking number (neither of these things happened...perhaps this should have been the sign of the dire experience to come). Tried calling the customer service desk, all operators are busy apparently...or, as it most likely the case, no one is there! Left endless voicemails requesting an update and a call back, nothing has been actioned. Emailed again to chase for an update, told (again by Tony (who I can assume is the only person there!)) that my order should have been delivered and he would follow up ASAP. 5 days later no update and no response to my latest request for a refund. Reported the issue to my bank who inform me they have had numerous issues with this company...stay well away from these thieves!!

Several phone calls due to it not being delivered yet being in stock on the website. He didn’t tick the “replace order if not available” box as we wanted the wine they had sold us. Skip to tonight when their customer advisor hung up on my husband trying to sort out where our order was once he asked for a refund (they took the money out of our account over 2 weeks ago) we’ve had no communication via email, telephone or snail mail except when we have called themI think this company sells wine they don’t yet own and promises to “upscale” it with something else when they cannot deliver. Thanks but we prefer to choose the items we order ourselves as advertised by you.Awaiting refund of severeral hundred pounds. Will never use again. We recommend you use a reputable company and not this one.

winedirect	IE	Totally Let Down - Late Delivery	08 November 2018	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I am very disappointed with the delivery and dispatch of my order . I made a purchase on Wednesday the 31st of October and the order was not delivered until Monday the 5th of November.I choose wine direct as I expected the delivery to be next day or within 48 hours. there were many other companies I could have used where this would have occurred. I paid extra for the delivery of the order, which occurred, but the whole purpose of this order was to have it delivered in advance of an event on Sunday.I will not be using your company again and I will not recommend your company either.
winedirect	GB	Terrible	06 November 2018	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	Terrible. Sounds like they’re having real problems. I’ve had the same poor service.I placed an order in September to be delivered as a gift. Over a month later, after numerous emails and phone calls, very few of which were responded to, it was eventually delivered.My order status online never changed so I wouldn’t trust that. I did eventually get through on the phone line and received a couple of responses by email. Tony was apologetic, pleasant and seemingly wanted to sort it out but then never did what he said he would or has responded to my last few requests to send confirmation.He said the problem was the delivery address and the courier couldn’t find it. I can understand as it was a remote address but no contact was ever made about attempted delivery. Given the response since, I don’t believe it was ever dispatched until a month later after I’d chased repeatedly. A delivery refund was agreed but was never received. Thankfully it did get delivered. I don’t know if they received what I ordered but cutting my losses. I wont be dealing with them again.

They seem to be re-launching as a company called Just in Cases, owned by Fermentation Limited, telephone goes through to same re-direct as Wine Direct, same address. Beware of both these companies as we suspect all is not as it seems. It is almost impossible to contact this company and it seems many people have not had their orders including us.Richard Ellison.

winedirect	GB	failure to deliver/non-existent communication - Avoid!!	01 November 2018	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Bought six bottles of wine at over £200 weeks ago now — still not delivered whilst having emailed their CS team several times, and called continually. It seems they have no one on their CS line to answer calls, and they certainly don’t respond. Unsure what to do at this point other than report to trading standards. Avoid at all costs!
winedirect	GB	BEWARE; DELIVERY & SERVICE PROBLEMS	01 November 2018	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	"BEWARE:  DELIVERY AND CUST SERVICE PROBLEM.   My order confirmation showed the different billing v shipping address correctly.  However, when ParcelForce sent the tracker, they had the WRONG shipping address---my billing address instead.  I tried WineDirect x3008 number from their website four times and just got answering machine.  I left 2 v-mails to say, ""Stop.  Correct the mistake you made on the shipping address.""   NO ANSWER EVER.  So I called ParcelForce, who said they couldn't change it until delivery failed.I had to arrange somebody to wait at my billing address to receive the wine.  CRAZY. So DON'T order with winedirect if your billing and shipping address differ.  They will confirm it correctly, but ship it wrong.  DON'T expect any response from anybody if you have a problem.  NOBODY answers EVER.  However, I did receive the correct bottles per my order, and they were well packaged.  So OK if you don't have any issues.  You go forewarned!"
winedirect	GB	A matter for the police?	01 November 2018	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	I'm having the same problem as everyone else. I ordered at the start of October. They took my money and now, at the beginning of November, I have heard precisely nothing. Emails and calls go unanswered. Considering what everyone else is experiencing, I begin to think this is a police matter.
winedirect	GB	Longer deliver timeframe than expected	31 October 2018	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	My delivery was a gift and I chose this site over any other gift site specifically because of the FAQ stating a 1-3 day delivery time frame. After 6 days having not heard anything I sent an enquiry. A few days later my gift thankfully arrived, belated but appreciated, though no response to my query about the delay in the meantime. I actually DO think it’s an acceptable delivery time frame, however your FAQs need to reflect a true picture of how long it’s going to take so that customers can make an informed decision.
winedirect	GB	Same experience as others	29 October 2018	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Same experience as others.  I ordered wine in early September.  They claimed it was dispatched on 25th September.  No evidence of any attempt to deliver.  Either it's a scam (shame on the posts from mock reviewers) or the company has ceased trading.  DO NOT USE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES.
winedirect	GB	Company may have closed.	29 October 2018	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I ordered wine 13th Oct paid but have heard nothing since.  I have tried to follow up but cannot get hold of anyone at the website/store.  Looks like the company may have ceased trading.  Do not order from them!
winedirect	GB	This company appears to have gone broke!!	29 October 2018	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	This company appears to have gone to ground. I placed an order for 2 dozen bottle of wine on the 2nd October and after receiving nothing for 2 weeks I called on the 15th October and when I finally got through they told me that the wine will delivered on the 19th Oct. Still no wine. I have been calling for the past week and cannot get a response. Clearly they are in trouble. DO NOT ORDER WINE FROM THIS COMPANY, YOU WILL NEVER GET IT. They have my money and I don't like the chances of seeing it again.
winedirect	GB	Shocking service from start to finish	28 October 2018	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Shocking service from start to finish. Tony Aubrew failed to email and call when promised several times. Delivery promises aslo failed with no information. Will not order again
winedirect	GB	I think this company has crashed	25 October 2018	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Ordered 12 bottles on 21 Sept; 6 were delivered on 5 Oct, I called to chase the rest and was promised them by 11th Oct; they didn't come so I called again and eventually got through on 22nd after exchange of emails; promised balance again on Wed 24th, did not arrive; now no answer to emails, telephone never answered. Last company accounts (Nov 2017) filed at Companies House suggests big debts and insufficient trading income, so I suspect the chickens have now come home to roost.In short: DON'T PLACE AN ORDER WITH THEM - you put your money at risk.
winedirect	GB	AVOID	25 October 2018	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Same story as many others, ordered wine, credit card charged, after several weeks wine not delivered, impossible to contact - doesn't answer the phone, no reply to emails, no reply to chats or web-site contact form. AVOID!
winedirect	GB	Don’t use this company - you won’t get your wine	25 October 2018	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	We only received part of our order - we were then told a pack of lies about when the rest would arrive. They are now uncontactable. If you’ve ordered, would suggest contacting your credit card company as you may need to make a claim to get your money back. Spread the word on social media - they are not to be trusted.

winedirect	GB	Order delay but good corrective action	16 October 2018	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	"I wish I could give a more positive review, but I have only placed an order once, and experienced a problem with it. I ordered just a gift card, to be delivered to a friend for their birthday. I allowed two days for order processing and postage (which customer support have since confirmed is normally first class). A week after placing the order I found out that my friend had not received the gift card. I checked my email and noticed I had only had an acknowledgement of the order, and no further updates. I checked back on the website, and found the order status still showing as ""Acknowledged"". Once I e-mailed customer support, I got good service from Tony. The order was processed and dispatched immediately, and I received a email confirming the order was complete. I would give more stars for the customer service response, but the overall result was a gift card delivered a week late for my friend's birthday, which I cannot classify as ""an acceptable experience"".For WineDirect staff reading this review and wanting to check the details, the order number was 626258, and the order history still visible in my account on the website shows as 04/10/2018 Acknowledged; 11/10/2018: Dispatched."

winedirect	NZ	Terrible service - AVOID	09 October 2018	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	"Terrible service - AVOIDI ordered 6 bottles of Chardonnay for a birthday present and specifically stated that I did not want alternatives in case of product shortage. The order status sat as ""Order Acknowledged"" for weeks - I complained via email and left voicemails, but heard nothing back at all. A few days later and after I had written again to ask for a refund instead, suddenly I received an auto-email saying the wine had been dispatched and due for next day delivery. When I called the recipient to confirm, they said it had arrived but it was a mixture of red and white wine!!!!! I emailed the company to complain but (Unsuprisingly) never heard back!!! Terrible customer service and not the product I ordered! A first time customer that will never be back. I recommend using Fareham Wine Cellar instead - much much more reliable and reputable."

winedirect	GB	Terrible	06 October 2018	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	My order for a case of 6 bottles of Cloudy Bay Sauvignon Blanc was placed on 23rd August 2018, it was a present for my wife who had given birth the day before.When I hadn't had any update on the order 3 weeks later I called and spoke to an operative who apologised for the delay and said that it would be delivered by the middle of the next week at the latest and that an additional bottle would be included by way of compensation for the delay.When I still hadn't recieved the order or any further communication another week later I emailed and called again and finally managed to speak to the same operative. He advised that he would check with his supervisor and call me back within 20 minutes. I never received a call back.Finally received the order over 5 weeks late but disappointingly, without the additional bottle I was promised promised or any note of apology for the delay.During this time I tried calling numerous times but couldn't get through to anyone and never received any responses to emails.I have emailed them this commentary and they have not bothered to respond.

winedirect	GB	Excellent service and delivery	01 October 2018	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I wanted a specific type of champagne to celebrate my wife's forthcoming birthday.  Her favourite is no longer stocked by the company I've been buying it from for years, but I found it to be supplied by WineDirect at a couple of pounds cheaper than when I last bought it.  The two bottles I ordered arrived very well packed within 3 days, I was advised at every stage of the progress of my order, the courier arrived 5 minutes earlier than his scheduled time and I could track him on his journey.  I could also leave instructions for him should I have needed to go out, or re-arrange the delivery.  This is the first time I've used WineDirect - it won't be the last.

I emailed, but had not response. Luckily I had some direct emails rather than the one on the website from the last time, so I used those and got an answer ""I'll look into it"" but never heard another thing. Finally an email from APC overnight to say it is coming today, no advance warning, no time window. Last time I use this business."

Most of the time your deliveries have been quick, but in two instances this past summer they have been very late about 4 weeks or so. Also, I have been a bit upset by an order of 6 bottles of burgundy some 2 months ago. It was recommended by professional winetasters, but actually tasted like ...., i have 4 bottles left, and I see no other way out than to pour them into the gutter. I see it as a onetime mistake on my part and will continue to order from you in the future. You have interesting wines.Kindest regards,Per Halberg

winedirect	GB	Absolutely awful - AVOID!!!	21 September 2018	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	No tracking number for order as promised, no delivery on date promised, emails ignored, just an absolutely shambolic company. Avoid at all costs. I have now asked my credit card company to intervene and get my money back (first time ever) and have placed a new order for the same wine (but cheaper) with the Fine Wine Company in Edinburgh.
winedirect	AU	Best online experience yet!	19 September 2018	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	The staff at WineDirect were absolutely wonderful through from helping with my order, to delivery. One of the boxes of wine that I had selected was out of stock, so to ensure I had wine for our event, they offered a much nicer box at no extra cost, with express shipping. I would recommend WineDirect to anyone as their customer service was fantastic, and I got my order well within the delivery time frame.
winedirect	GB	Having ordered wine to be delivered on…absolutely shocking	18 September 2018	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Having ordered wine to be delivered on my dads birthday I was given all sorts of excuses about the courier company!! I had to go out and buy wine for my Dad so I didn’t face the embarrassment of not having a gift from him!! I tried calling, left voicemails but nobody had the decency to reply to me! Think twice about ordering from wine direct as they are charging a fortune for wine that was in stock yet they are incapable of sending out on time despite telling me it would be sent the day before to ensure delivery!!
winedirect	GB	You'll never get your wine	17 September 2018	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	As pervious people have pointed out:1. You order the wine2. It's not delivered3. You email them and chase and finally you get excuses about only part of the order being available4. You ask them to ship that part of the order5. You still recieve nothing6. They stop answering emails or the phone7. You raise a dispute with your credit card companySo - To try and help others, if you have paid over £100 on your credit card, search for 'Section 75 claim', if you've paid on your  credit card and it's under £100, look for 'chargeback scheme' on your credit card companies website.I think Wine Direct might have been made insolvent and 'Fermentation Wines' (the name on my email invoice) was mentioned and oddly, it's the same name as the Director - therefore God knows what dodgy dealings are going on.Either way, I would suggest you avoid as I've just contacted my credit card company for the first time EVER to get my money back.

winedirect	GB	Use their services at your peril	29 August 2018	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Have some excellent wines and offer good price reductions from time to time. However, when they fail to deliver - as they frequently seem to do - their customer care service is the pits! Nothing is forthcoming from them in the way of information or explanation - you have to do all the chasing down. and even then getting any kind of response is akin to getting blood from out of a stone! Reluctantly, having used them for some while, I have come to the conclusion that they do not deserve to continue trading.

Still no one answered despite the “usual response time of 1 hour”.Still no wines the following day so I tried calling again and guess what? No answer.... thankfully I left an angry message and email and someone called me straight away. This gentleman advised that the wines would be delivered the next day.So here I am on thmy next day and you guessed it! Still no wines and when I try call? It’s almost too predictable, no answer....All I want are the three wines I ordered over a week ago. When I have those, I can guarantee that this is a service I will never use again.

winedirect	GB	Is the company solvent?	07 August 2018	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I’m concerned on the solvency of the company. I have used WineDirect a number of times before but have noticed that the past few deliveries have been a real slog in not coming through. I put an order in June that I am still to receive and no responses or ability to call. I’m worried that the company is not going to be able to meet its obligation. My order was for £590 so I’m thinking of perhaps going to MasterCard to see if they can reverse the transaction. What a shame as they have a good website and good products.
winedirect	GB	Quick delivery and good service	07 August 2018	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	We ordered a batch of around 24 wines, having been to South Africa and hunting down all the wines we enjoyed whilst there. I ordered on a Monday evening and had a phone call on Wednesday to inform  that 3 of the 24 bottles were not available, unless on a 2 week order, so i swapped those 3, and all of our wines were received on the Friday lunch time. Great service, good communication and most importantly fab wines.
winedirect	GB	Excellent wines, room for improvement in service delivery	07 August 2018	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	The range of wines they have is really exceptional. My only gripe is the delivery and following up on complaints, these two areas really need to be improved. Nonetheless I will continue to order from them because I have experienced more hits than misses with them.

I was advised that 6 were out of stock but the other 6 were dispatched promptly.  I was informed a week later that my chosen wine was now in stock and was duly received the next day.  i was kept up to date by email from time of order to dispatch and appreciate the service I received.  I did read some negative reviews on here but my experience was positive and will have no hesitation in using this company again and can complement Tony for communicating with us about the delay and offer to credit us due to the delay  - we were happy to wait and not disappointed

Think there is room for improvement in the communication channel from Wine Direct to its customers, as on the two ocassions we have used Wind Direct we have had to ask for a progress update.  Not a deal breaker but would prefer not to have to chase for updates.

winedirect	GB	4 Year's of brilliance	19 July 2018	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	I've ordered from wine direct for over 4 year's now. Been into the shop on a handful of occasions to collect my order and it's been delivered to my new address out of town, without issue. Displeased to see all the negative review's, as they are good people. I struggle myself, with dealing the post Whatsapp Culture in my own company. I've had people threaten to come to my house and physically harm me over a 4 day delivery wait (Free Service). Completely unrealistic expectations in this new era of the internet > This is not an american conglomerate, It's a wine cellar for Christ sake.Am i bothered in the slightest if i have to wait 1/2/3/4 weeks for the wine............. no - because they deliver the value every single time. Thank you WineDirect for pleasing my Palate for the last 4 years and long may it continue.Keep up the good work.-------------------------------------UPDATE----------------------------------------------The owner of winedirect.co.uk needs to invest in better infrastructure to manage outstanding orders and unanswered emails. Zendesk would be a good starting point. Basic SLA's would need to be met to keep customers returning My outstanding orders have still not arrived nor has there been any clarity of when to expect my outstanding delivery despite my attempts to get in contact with them. I'm more frustrated because i really love ordering from this company and would like to see them do better than they're doing. I'm not particular sure why the owner would neglect such a great business like this, Real shame. Won't discourage future orders but doesn't fill you with great confidence going forward
winedirect	GB	The wine was delivered on schedule	18 July 2018	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	The wine was delivered on schedule. The tracking system and email notification was very helpful.

winedirect	GB	Wedding wine	18 July 2018	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	We used WineDirect to source the wine for our wedding and could not be happier with the service provided. We had a couple of conversations ahead of the order to ensure that they could provide the quantity of wine within the required time frame. The wine was delivered on time and we received great communication throughout. Thank you again for the excellent service and fantastic range of wine.

winedirect	GB	Beware	11 July 2018	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	"Beware, this company's customer service is really poor.  The range of wine they offer is excellent and their prices are competitive but despite quoting ""Standard delivery time frame is 3-5 days"" on their website, I have never received any shipment in less that 7 working days and sometimes it's been 10 -12 days and only then because I called or emailed to chase my order. Given that many of their competitors provide free next day delivery if you spend more than £100, its really irritating to be charged £7.50 for a half case or £9.95 for a case and then it takes 10 days to actually deliver the stuff !!"

I have done this before from other Italian Vineyards. However Winedirect had the wines I wanted and the delivered price would be about the same. So I placed a £170 order on 12th June. (Not having looked at Trustpilot!). Having heard nothing since then I emailed them a few days ago and received an email saying the status had changed to being processed and yesterday another saying dispatched. The wine was delivered a few minutes ago. Delivery would have taken as long if I had ordered direct from Italy so I am happy with the service and would use Winedirect again.
winedirect	GB	OMG. Shockingly BAD	05 July 2018	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	OMG. withiut doubt the worst experience of online shopping and terrible customer service.

winedirect	GB	WORST ONLINE WINE EXPERIENCE EVER and I…	05 July 2018	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	WORST ONLINE WINE EXPERIENCE EVER and I would never ever order from them again. This company is so bad I cannot believe that they are still in business. I doubt whether any of the good reviews are genuine.  Just a few of the issues I faced:-- Delivery times was very slow. It took 2 weeks to receive the order because one of the wines was out of stock, but they didn't tell me and I had to call and e-mail twice to find this out. Twice I was assured that delivery would be made on a certain day but no wine arrived- I specifically stated that I would NOT accept substitutions of wines OR vintages but they ignored this and sent a different vintage of one of the wines- One of the wines was shown as 75 cl but when delivered it was a 50 cl bottle. I sent it back for a refund and it took 3 e-mails and 4 WEEKS for the refund to be processed to my credit card- Several times when I tried to call them to find out what was happening the phones were disconnected and I couldn't even leave a voice message  Quite frankly this was the worst customer service I have ever experienced ordering wine or any other product and I would NEVER use them again.
winedirect	US	Order online, customer service is completely offline	04 July 2018	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	"I feel like I've been teleported back to 2001. Because that's probably the year when the user experience of WineDirect was designed - including the dated web site. I should have trusted my gut feel when I placed the order.My order was just ""acknowledged"" for a couple of weeks. No word on how or when it would be fulfilled. Noone answered my emails or phone calls.All of a sudden - after leaving a voice mail - the order moved forward to being ""processed"". And frankly, not to long thereafter it shipped.So - what I ordered was eventually delivered but by todays standards it took AGES and the customer service and consumer experience TERRIBLE."
winedirect	GB	Appalling experience	04 July 2018	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	In June I placed an order with winedirect that was mainly paid for through a £100 voucher. I  received an automated email acknowledging the order, and the order status said the wine would be shipped once paymenjt had cleared. The remainder of the payment left my bank the following Tuesday. After that nothing. Complete silence for over two weeks now, although I have emailed and have called customer service and left messages (phone not answered). Then I came across this website and see that my experience is far from unique. I'll give it another couple of days, but then I'll take the complaint to the Consumer Ombudsman.
winedirect	GB	Nothing but good from WineDirect	03 July 2018	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Nothing but good from WineDirect. Ordering was easy, wine price reasonable, delivery charges ok.

winedirect	GB	AVOID AVOID	29 June 2018	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	AVOID AVOID ! They don't answer their phone or emails. Let me clarify my review as I have just been asked to reconsider it. I ordered 12 bottles special South African Wine for two events I was having Tuesday & Wednesday night. When I called WineDirect a day before the event on the Tuesday Tony informed me they did not have my wine - but not to worry they would send a replacement wine. But as I had only called on Monday it would not make it there by the Tuesday (first night of event) but definitely for Wednesday the second night of event. At approx. 4pm on Wednesday while setting up for the second event I was stressing out as the wine had not been delivered. Then I tried and tried to call WineDirect and just got through to Voice Mail & no answer on email. So I had to run around like a made thing moments before the event to find wine. I never got the wine or a phone call apologizing hence the review. Then I had to call and call and email and email for a refund!!This is the reason for my review. I would avoid this company - terrible.

winedirect	GB	Long time customer	25 June 2018	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	I have been using WineDirect for 8 years, not exclusively but as one of several wine merchants I order from.I find the excerpts from several reviews helpful and on the wines I purchase I find the pricing competitive. I wish there were more older wines available but this a complaint I have with most online stores.I have had no problems with deliveries. I am fortunate that in recent years I have mainly lived in buildings with a porter who can accept delivery. I always insist that the there be no substitution of vintage or wine and am prepared for a delivery to be delayed until it can be fulfilled or for it to be delivered more quickly but with perhaps one or more bottles not included.In short I find they have a good variety, fair prices and good descriptions.

I HAVE LOST NEARLY £300.00 BECAUSE OF THIS	20 June 2018	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I ordered wine from this company to be sent to a village in Suffolk on 24 April 2018. After many promises of delivery, nothing was delivered, and when I finally got through to the man in charge - rarely there - someone called Tony Abreu, he apologised, agreed that the wine was not on the way, cancelled the order - he said - and promised a refund.One month later nothing had been paid back, and I started to ring him again. I have now rung some 8 times, I have emailed and though Mr Abreu, when I managed to get him on the phone promised to look into it and ring me back, I have had no phone call, no money, and today, June 20th they are not answering the phone.I have lost  £270.95.

winedirect	GB	Result - eventually	18 June 2018	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	I am having the same problems as the most recent reviews - they took payment on the order date (20/5), but have not responded to my various requests via email / phone message for an update (I started trying to contact them around a week ago).  I may also resort to reporting to the bank as fraudulent to get a refund if I don't hear anything by the end of this week.  I had originally taken comfort from some of the reviews that others had eventually been in touch with someone at WineDirect and orders were being fulfilled, but the more recent feedback unfortunately suggests that things are not going well.Update - even more annoyingly, I've just received a marketing email from them continuing to advertise the summer clearance sale!!21st June update - potentially off the back of the above review, I was finally contacted a couple of days ago.  I was reassured that my wine was just being processed and I could expect delivery in the next couple of days.  It has just arrived.  The delays were explained as due to a warehouse move, however the erratic/lack of contact and an explanation is really unacceptable regardless.  As the wine I have purchased is difficult to get elsewhere I would probably use WineDirect again, however I wouldn't have any expectation that it will arrive quickly.

The owner doesn't respond to emails and spins you a yarn when you call. Companies house shows a change in directors so I can only assume the company is getting into difficulty and cannot for fill orders.I wouldn't recommend them id shop elsewhere if you want your wine before the years out !

Truly the worst of the worst in terms of customer support - I have been completely ignored when chasing non delivery of my order. E-mails, phone calls and voice messages all ignored. I've had to resort to reporting the transaction as fraudulent with Barclaycard to seek a refund that way, as this crowd of crooks have taken my money and gone completely to ground. I'm expecting to read they have gone bust any day now as their customer (no) support line goes direct to a voice mail service that no-one ever replies to. Deal with this shower of crooks at your peril.

winedirect	GB	A SHAMBLES DISGUISED BY A PLAUSIBLE WEBSITE	08 June 2018	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	"WHITE?  RED?  IT'S ALL GREEK TO THESE PEOPLE.  They have every appearance of being out of their depth.  On 29 May I ordered a mixed (3x2) case of Greek white wines.  The order was ""acknowledged"" the same day.  The website leads one to believe that delivery will take place between one and three days later, so on 4 June, with the ""My Orders"" page still showing nothing but ""acknowledged"", I tried telephoning.  I was diverted straight through to voicemail, which I did not use, instead administering a prod by email.  Had I not done so, I have every reason to believe that I'd still be waiting for something to happen.  My email produced a phone call 24 hours later from one Tony, who explained that none of the wines I had ordered were in stock, but that as I had made clear I would accept substitutes, he could send me some alternatives.  I said that would be fine - as long as the alternatives were white.  We agreed a delivery date.  Shortly afterwards Tony emailed to say that he could, after all, let me have two of the three wines I had originally ordered, and would only need to substitute one. Delivery (ten days after placing the order) was on schedule, but when I opened the case, I found nothing but substitutes after all, two of which were an unwanted red.Tony came across as well-meaning and helpful, and probably doing a stressful job with little thanks.  But if people offer a service, I don't expect to have to make all the running myself; and it would be nice to finish up with products which bear more than a passing resemblance to what I asked for.Because of the initial lack of communication, and the disappointing final outcome, I do not recommend Wine Direct, and shall not use them again.PS - I don’t wish to alter my assessment above, but it’s only fair to record that, about an hour after it was published, I received an apologetic telephone call from Helen, of Hailsham Cellars (not sure of the connection with Wine Direct, but no matter), who sorted everything out to my complete satisfaction by ten o'clock the next day.  She sounded very capable, and anxious to put a stop to the aberrations of Wine Direct.  Though I shan’t use Wine Direct again, I do wish Helen and her colleagues well in turning around and making a success of their business, which in principle has much to offer wine enthusiasts."

winedirect	GB	Don't touch these people	04 June 2018	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Ordered wine, it didn't arrive, 2 weeks later got an email asking if I would accept a different vintage. I said no I would like a refund. It never arrived, Customer Services took days to reply to my chasing email then suggested that they had requested the refund but colleagues in Finance had not put it through. Now they are saying they put it through as a credit to my credit card when blatantly it is not true. Avoid this unreliable company.

We are too quick to complain and not quick enough to praise so forgive the delay in singing your praises. First class experience all round. Cheers.

My credit card was charged for the order on 3rd April.3. On 20th April  WineDirect started to process the order.4. On 26th April 2 out 3 boxes of the order are delivered.5. On 11th May I chase up Wine Direct about the missing box to be told 'We heard back from the courier and the third parcel was damaged during the transport.'6.

However, having vintage substitutions is a real shame.As for the communication - well.....No response to an email. Left a voicemail (cannot talk to a real person) and finally a few days later things moved with a short sharp email. Wines arrived today as stated in that email.I'll never use them again even though the wines I ordered are hard to find elsewhere.
winedirect	GB	Good service.	24 May 2018	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	One wine which was accepted on ordering online was not available. I had a phone call from the company to explain that it was not available and to ask if I would like to wait for it to arrive or would I accept a substitute. Not happy that the wine I wanted was not available, but very happy with the situation was dealt with and how the ordered was fulfilled and delivered.
winedirect	GB	Very very poor	24 May 2018	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Very very poor! One of two cases delivered was the incorrect wine. When I asked for the mistake to be corrected by email and by phone (twice), I was fobbed off with assurances and even given a date when the courier would collect the wrong case but no one turned up. Avoid.

Still no wine.  I said if they could not deliver to refund my money.  No refund and I am chasing this company every few days.  I will take this to Trading standards shortly.
winedirect	GB	My order was never delivered	09 May 2018	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	My order was never delivered.  Issues with the courier were blamed, which I understand can happen, but repeated promises of action and feedback were never honoured. I will never deal with the company again.
winedirect	GB	Clearly not interested in my business........	08 May 2018	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	After an initial telephone conversation, I was told that my enquiry about wine for a wedding would need to be dealt with by the person dedicated to that. This person was meant to call me but hasn't. I sent 2 messages via the website asking for someone to contact me but, again, nothing. I persevered because one of the wines I wanted was only available through a small number of sources in the UK, one of which is WineDirect. Over a month has now passed since my initial contact.This order was, potentially, for 2-300 bottles of wine but I am now in the process of ordering from elsewhere. The other feedback/reviews I've been reading (below) from other customers suggest that their customer service leaves a lot to be desired and that I've made the right decision.
winedirect	GB	Delivered on time	08 May 2018	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Delivered on time. Great wine!

winedirect	NZ	Atrocious customer service	01 May 2018	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	"Atrocious customer service.  Immediate email confirmation of my wine order but then everything went into a black hole, which was the most frustrating part.  No update on my order by email or online.  Status remained as ""acknowledged"". Emails went unanswered.  Eventually my brother in the UK managed to make contact with Tony via phone and I then had an email response from Tony.  Wines were delivered 2.5 weeks later, many as ordered.  I had agreed to substitutions and the white wine substitutions were fine.  However a big price difference between the 6 ordered Aussie Shiraz and 6 delivered Aussie Shiraz (same wine producer).So beware! You need persistence and patience if you intend dealing with Wine Direct."
winedirect	GB	Really poor customer service	30 April 2018	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Really poor customer service.  Phoned on a Tuesday to check that it would arrive by Saturday for my parents 50th Wedding Anniversary and they assured me that it would leave their warehouse Wednesday for delivery Thursday.  It did not arrive till Monday, 2 days too late for the party.  Do not bother trying to call, as I tried many times and only got a voicemail, left messages with no response from the company.  Avoid!
winedirect	SE	DONT USE WINE DIRECT!!	27 April 2018	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	DONT USE WINE DIRECT!!Shonky and shady business. Absolutely no level of trust for this company. My threats of police reporting and fraud were the only things that promoted any sort of communications from them. I feel I was very lucky to get a refund.
winedirect	GB	Delivery time is a joke!	21 April 2018	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I ordered my wine to take with me to London. It did not tell me a delivery date when placing the order.  After a few days of hearing nothing I contacted Wine Direct and asked when I could expect delivery. The answer was ‘processing’. I said the response was inadequate and requested a firm delivery date. I was told before 12:00 on Saturday 14/4/18. It did not happen. I have since had to rearrange the delivery to Monday 23/4/18 and of course had to come to London without the wine I had ordered. I have never felt so let down by a company. In this day and age it should not take seven days to deliver a box of wine!
winedirect	GB	Shambles.	19 April 2018	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Shambles.Said wine was in stock, but then took over a week of promised/failed deliveries to admit the wine wasn't in stock. Then said the wine was coming direct from the importer, then it didn't arrive. Lots of broken promises to follow up and never did. Not even sure this is a legit business - incompetence I haven't come across before.Would never use/recommend again.
winedirect	GB	Product fine but delivery was a problem.	18 April 2018	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	Product fine but delivery was a problem. Case was for anniversary present.Product was in stock and had expected the 3-5 day delivery, which would have given me a couple of days spare, but product not despatched until two days before event. Delivery information was not clear as to when it would arrive. As it was a weekend was not sure they would deliver on saturday. enough. As it happened it arrived on the morning of the event 15 mins before we were due to leave. So a stressful purchase. But the wine was well received!

winedirect	GB	inconsistent & Untrustworthy	14 April 2018	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Multiple bad experiences with them taking money and the order not appearing for weeks, incorrect orders and very poor communications. Make false promises. Clearly are not direct as they hold little stock and have to generally order your order from their suppliers. WineIndirect would be a better name. I use over 20 wine suppliers and review wines daily - these are by far the worst suppliers out there. Avoid.

winedirect	GB	Only half of order delivered and no reply to enquiries	13 April 2018	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I placed a large order and after no communication on when it would turn up, only part of the order arrived. Still chasing the rest of the order worth hundreds of pounds, no response to emails and voicemails. Completely ripped off.
winedirect	GB	Late delivery, no followup and wrong order	13 April 2018	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	There was no communication about the order for 9 working days. No reply to my email inquiring about the order. I had to call twice to check when it was going to get dispatched. And when it finally did arrive, they sent the wrong vintage, even though according to their customer service they had the one i wanted in stock. My husband's order is also still MIA after two weeks since order date...

Several emails unanswered, several calls answered by voicemail but unsurprisingly not returned. I suspect their business model is to part-ship the orders while charging the credit card in full, hoping that customers will not notice.THINK TWICE BEFORE USING THIS COMPANY!

winedirect	GB	Very poor company to deal with.	06 April 2018	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Very poor company to deal with and I will never order with them again.  More than 2 weeks after ordering I still have not received my wine. I spoke to some one 3 days ag who assured me it would arrive yesterday. Some one waited in all day and it didn’t. Taken a look on the web sight this morning and it hasn’t even been shipped. Appalling service

winedirect	AU	The whole process was easy from start to finish	27 March 2018	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	We recently ordered some Australian wine to be delivered to my UK brother-in-law for his 60th birthday.  Am happy to say the whole process from start to finish was easy.  There were alternate delivery details, and as our family are often away from their house, I left a message for the wine to be left with a neighbour if they were not at home.  Our instructions were followed, delivery was made, and we have one very happy brother-in-law.
winedirect	ES	Best selection of wines. Mixed experience good and bad!	26 March 2018	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	I’ve ordered from Wine Direct about 6-7 times. My first experience with them was not great due to their lack of comms and not letting me know about wines not being in stock. I chased them a few times and was advised to allow substitutes to make the order come quicker. It’s a shame their website doesn’t indicate if an item is in stock so customers can make informed decisions. The next 5 orders were pretty stress free and went without any major hiccups but again a few things not in stock but in general ok. This last order made at the beginning of March has been annoying. They sent me the right amount of bottles but sent wine I didn’t ask for and charged me for wine which didn’t arrive. First email to wine Direct was responded to by Tony who said he would investigate, he explained there must have been a problem at the warehouse but not too worry. Since then I have sent 3 chasers over the last couple of weeks and heard nothing back. Very disappointing seeing as I’ve spent nearly £1k with them in the last year. It’s a shame as they have a great selection of wine and you don’t have to buy by the case. Badly managed and Under staffed is my guess. Come on Winedirect, pull yourself together otherwise you will lose a lot of good customers!UPDATE 27/03/18: customer services got in touch to say they have refunded me the money for the missing wine and they didn’t charge me for the one they sent by mistake. We’ll got there in the end!  I’ll go back to them again
winedirect	GB	Very mixed experience	26 March 2018	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	Placing order, easy, paying for an order easy IF you allow substitutions and vintage changes, contacting them to chase an order a nightmare. Used to be a lot better before they relocated.
winedirect	GB	Excellent service	26 March 2018	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Excellent service, very quick delivery. Superb wine.
winedirect	GB	£60 bottle of wine ordered as a special…	22 March 2018	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	£60 bottle of wine ordered as a special present. Their couriers delivered it to a house over the road....no card so the recipient unaware for 2 days. Wine Direct let me know the number of the house my special present had been dumped at but didnt reply to a message after that. After calling 6 times at the house my wine had been dumped at....shouting through letterbox....arguing with residents....they finally handed the package over.Obviously this is the couriers fault but 1 star to Wine Direct for ignoring my 2nd email when they already knew there was a problem with delivery of a very expensive bottle of wine.
winedirect	GB	Shocking - do not use this company	21 March 2018	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Shocking - never use this company. They take your money and only deliver half the order.  Trying to get in contact with them has been a nightmare. Phone calls, emails, twitter. They did finally respond and say they'd look into my complaint but nothing.  I've read other reviews and it seems we're not the only ones with issues with them.  They either owe us wine or a £50 refund so not an insignificant amount. There wine range seemed good but they obviously cannot match their customer service or contract to delivery once you've ordered. I'm in the process of contacting Trading Standards as they are in breach.

winedirect	PT	Terrible experience!	15 March 2018	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	It was my first and will be certainly my last order with WineDirect.The order was placed on a Monday evening and shipped only on Friday, to be delivered Wednesday next week. After sending an e-mail (no reply), tried to call on Friday morning (left voice mail message) to get an update on the order and its estimated delivery date. No reply either.To make thinngs really worse, what I've received isn't what I had ordered: ordered 2016 vintage, received 2017 vintage. And I had specifically stated in the order that changes on the vintage weren't accepted.Totally unprofessional from WineDirect. Unacceptable.
winedirect	ZA	Do not part with your money with this company!	14 March 2018	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	As others have found the service that winedirect offers beyond poor and do not even deserve one star. After 5 weeks I have received no contact from them regarding my order. Total silence. But money was immediately taken from me, so at least that part of their service is efficient and as it stands the only thing.

winedirect	GB	Abysmal customer service	12 March 2018	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	"Doh - I wish I'd read the reviews here first.....Ordered £222 wine 7th Feb - order confirmed by emailFAIL - heard nothing for about 10 days, had to call them for an update. FAIL - it's 50/50 whether someone picks up the 'phone. (Don't waste time leaving a message)Got through, no explanation for radio silence, arranged delivery for 20th Feb; my partner agreed to stay at home all day (it's the usual opacity on delivery time).FAIL - 20th Feb, no delivery, no communication, very irritated partnerFAIL - no response to repeated calls, left answerphone messages, sent emailFAIL - Fri 23rd Feb, email from Tony Abreu: two items from my order were sold out - that's the reason nothing was delivered. SO WHY DID YOU LET ME PAY FOR ITEMS SOLD OUT? GET YOUR STOCK MANAGEMENT IN SHAPE IT SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN FAULTY FOR YEARS (read reviews below). Offered Monday (26th) delivery which I replied to within 25minutes offering three half day slots when I would be home mon/tue/fri.FAIL - No response to my email by close of business Mon 26th - ie the day THEY had offered for delivery. Sent them email asking for a response to my suggestions of delivery slots.FAIL - chased Winedirect by calling twice on 27th Feb.Received email from Andrew Birtley 1st March: Winedirect was planning to ship to me for delivery Mon 26th but decided to postpone in order to avoid wine sitting in a delivery warehouse over the weekend of freezing [beast from the east] temperatures. Fair enough. BUT WHY DIDN""T YOU SIMPLY LET ME KNOW RATHER THAN LEAVE ME WONDERING WHETHER I SHOULD STAY AT HOME LONGER ON THAT MONDAY TO RECEIVE THE WINE? USELESS CUSTOMER SERVICE AGAIN. Mr Birtley concludes by telling me Winedirect plans to ship on Monday 5th March for Tues 6th delivery (again not checking whether that suits me), and that Tony will be in touch on Monday 5th [to update me].FAIL - no one contacts me on Monday 5thFAIL - 3 of 9 bottles arrive (from my now smaller order, two bottles being out of stock). I write an email just before midday, reporting this and gingerly asking whether the rest would arrive on the same day, as promised! ho ho ho. No response - no surprise.I then write another email after close of business on 6th March entitled ""WHAT ON EARTH IS GOING ON?,"" pointing out that 6 bottles are missing as is my refund for the 2 not available.FAIL - no response. I have to call Winedirect and get through to Tony Abreu on 8th March who tells me the outstanding 6 bottles are out for delivery.....whereupon I inform him I am calling from a plane to the airport and I'm going on holiday so no one will be home. WHY DID YOU ARRANGE THE SECOND DELIVERY WITHOUT TELLING, OR INFORMING ME WHEN IT WAS DUE TO BE DELIVERED? He offers to get in touch with the courier to redeliver but we both 'agree' it would be better (and safer!) for me to sort it out. He also informs me my refund has been processed and I should receive it within 2-3 days. The courier attempts a delivery; no one is home; an ""unfortunately you weren't in"" card is left which I collect on returning from holiday and use to arrange delivery for the next day I am home, Thur Mar 15th. FAIL - No sign yet of the refund for the bottles I paid for over four weeks ago - YOU APPARENTLY DISCOVERED THE BOTTLES WEREN'T AVAILABLE 23RD FEB, AND I CONFIRMED I WANTED A REFUND NOT A SUBSTITUTION THE SAME DAY - OVER TWO WEEKS AGO - SO WHY WASN'T THE REFUND PROCESSED THEN? DO YOU HAVE CASHFLOW DIFFICULTIES, WINEDIRECT? ARE YOU A RISKY COUNTERPARTY? On a personal note each time I spoke with Tony Abreu it felt like he was genuinely trying to help....but unfortunately had a total lack of empathy with how dire the customer experience had been, and was barely apologetic.It goes without saying I won't be ordering from Winedirect ever again, and I'll report them as fraudulent to my bank card issuer at the end of this week if I don't receive my refund.But the point of writing this review, dear reader, and spending so much of my time doing so, is to give you a gift - the gift of dodging the Winedirect bullet.BUY ELSEWHERE. LIFE IS TOO SHORT TO DEAL WITH SUCH POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE.Cheers!EPILOGUE 26th March 2018The wine finally arrived on (several times adjusted) schedule. Unfortunately after 3 of 6 bottles it tastes 'flat' - really lacking in any zing/acidity which I was expecting from this highly rated (92pts - James Suckling) Chilean Chardonnay. I am not a forensic wine expert but I wonder about its storage temperatures, or maybe age? It is not the current vintage but I would have expected the experts' ""drink now"" recommendations to mean at least 1 more year to enjoy it. Oh well, little point in deciding again never to use this vendor."
winedirect	GB	Only half the order delivered and yet all the money taken. No customer service at all.	11 March 2018	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I ordered wine from WineDirect and only half of the order was delivered even though they took the whole amount. Now no-one wants to reply to my calls or emails. I have tried repeatedly over the past two weeks and have not been able to make contact with anyone. This is totally unacceptable. I am contacting my credit card company to see if I can get the money back. After that it's my lawyer.
winedirect	GB	Mixed reviews!!	07 March 2018	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	Given the very mixed reviews, literally from one extreme to another, I decided to add my two pennies worth!  I received my order - nearly 3 weeks after placing it. I have bought from Wine Direct before. Most of the time with no problem. So what happened this time? Delays were caused because part of my order was not in stock. Their shortcomings are that they don't tell customers. Zero comms and it is human nature to assume the worst. Instead they simply wait until the whole order comes in from their suppliers before dispatching the complete order. To not communicate this with customers is sacrilege. When they eventually sort out their communication problem (possibly by hiring an extra person!!) I would rate them 4 / 5 stars as their prices are still very competative and their range is better than most.
winedirect	GB	I wish there was a nil star option- truly awful	07 March 2018	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I wish there was a nil star option. I  ordered a half case of  wine  difficult to source in the UK - hence my attraction to  the web site-  on 17 February expecting delivery within 4 days for a friend's birthday. No delivery, despite  sending  two emails and ringing three  times. On each occasion I was put though to an automated answering machine service. One call was returned by  man called Tony who promised me that the wine would dispatched on 26 February. It was not .I have notified my credit card copy to obtain a refund and will never use WineDirect again.

winedirect	AU	Stupid me for believing they couldn’t be as bad as last time.	03 March 2018	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Against my better judgment having reviewed here that I would never use them again, I gave them another shot. The only reason being I wanted a particular wine that I couldnt source elsewhere. As before, my order arrived incomplete and on emailing the customer service so team I have still heard nothing in the form of a reply. Once again when trying to call you either do not get answered or are told customer services are all busy. I dare say responding to the many dissatisfied customers.  Shocking service again. This time I’ll stand by my word.
winedirect	GB	Great customer service!	03 March 2018	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Very happy with feedback. They did not have the vintage I ordered and emailed me straight away to ask if they could replace with the latest vintage. They then telephoned to say the delivery was on its way. Would definitely recommend.

They arrived at different periods over more than three weeks. When I went online (twice) to ask where the wine was there was no response. When I called I was told it was coming tomorrow, which was only partially true, the rest came much later. The guy in the call centre seemed surprised no one had contacted me to inform me of the delivery status. Because it didn't arrive when they said it would I had to panic and dash to Majestics the night of my party. To be balanced -  their choice is good, I now have all my wine and the price was fair, but the delivery and client communication needs to improve.

The wine exactly as ordered was then delivered overnight by a very able carrier APC.  It was exceptionally well packed.This wine is difficult to source and I am therefore delighted with WineDirect.
winedirect	IE	Do not order from this company.	24 February 2018	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Do not order from this company. I can’t be clearer than that.Absolutely useless. I am so sorry I was foolish enough to place an order before doing some in depth research. I accept my own responsibility for this.Their customer service is nonexistent, they are incapable of following up on any issue.I can’t tell what the wine is like as they haven’t delivered it yet,If it was possible to give zero stars I would.
winedirect	GB	Hopeless, incompetent, and still unresolved.	22 February 2018	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Don't order anything from wine direct. Especially not wine. My story begins almost a month ago. I ordered a specific year of a specific wine. The order never arrived. I chased it up, and WD eventually informed me that the wine had been broken in transit by the courier, so never delivered.Fine. A fresh order was sent out and was successfully delivered. Opened it up. Wrong year. Onto the phones, get an answer 'we'll call you back to organise collecting the wine, and sending out the correct year'.And that's it. Nothing happens. They never call back. I always chase, calling up to six times a day.And I'm still waiting. Oh look, it's time to try and call them YET AGAIN...
winedirect	IE	Genuine firm with some flaws	22 February 2018	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	I dealt with this firm before I read any reviews but doubt if I would have done so otherwise as most of the reviews are very bad. I have ordered twice from them and on both occasions issues arose but in fairness they resolved the problems to my satisfaction. On the plus side they have a great selection of wine but the information on their website is not accurate. Some of the wines do not exist at all or the vintage is not as advertised. However once the problem is brought to their attention in my experience they will do their best to resolve it. I have had many conversations over the telephone with both Tony and Helen who are very nice to deal with. I was compensated on both occasions by being given complementary bottles of wine. I would use them again but before ordering online I recommend contacting them directly to place an order so as to be sure that they have the wines you require.
winedirect	GB	This company went above and beyond	20 February 2018	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	This company went above and beyond. I would recommend whole heartedly. Great choices of wine, and speedy delivery. Get choosing! Thank you ever so much.

winedirect	GB	WineDirect doesn't deserve even one…	19 February 2018	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	WineDirect doesn't deserve even one star! I ordered a box of wines on 2nd February, The website informed me that on the 6th the order was being processed, for delivery in Bucks. It is now the 19th and still no delivery. When I phoned I (once) got through and was promised that the matter would be investigated immediately. I am still waiting for a reply. Every other time I phone (during office hours) I am told by an automated voice that there's no one available to take a call. Does this business actually exist, or is it a scam, or run by total incompetents?

winedirect	GB	Terrible terrible company, get your wine elsewhere…	16 February 2018	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	This is probably the first review I've left any company/restaurant in my life but feel its worth making.  Ordered a case of 6 bottles and heard nothing from them for 14 days until I got a call saying a bottle was broken and getting a replacement was taking awhile so I agreed to replace that one bottle with a better bottle.  Case came and was not the wine I ordered!!  To rub salt into the wound, the replacement bottle that was promised to be much nicer as an apology for the 2+ week delay was barely more expensive than the ones I ordered and, from the website, looks like it was on sale so they were dumping stock on me!!  Just terrible terrible company.  I'm not a typically bitter customer and, again, rarely make comments...this is me saying stay away at all costs.

winedirect	GB	Wine Direct. A Terrible Wine Distribution Company	15 February 2018	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Wine Direct actually have a great selection of wine, however their  distribution and customer service (after sales care) is potentially one of the worst offerings since the dawn of e-commerce.For historical context, my 3rd order was back in 2013 and though delivered on time, I was delivered the wrong order. Took 2 weeks to resolve (once i got through to someone mind you).I recently placed my 4th order and last order from Wine Direct, having place the order on the 30/01/18, it is stuck on status of 'Acknowledged' and have had no update to this day 15/02/2018I have tried to contact multiple times via email and telephone and am getting no answer. The phone is always forwarded to a Tony Abreu? No mention of Wine Direct or Fermentation Ltd.I am shocked at the state of customer service. This is 2018. I have no choice but to call my bank / credit card company and make a claim, as I am now £150 out of pocket. Please avoid all. There are much better companies to order wine from. Heres a list for the benefit of potential customers and Wine Direct to benchmark from.- The Good Wine Shop (thegoodwineshop.co.uk) - Lea & Sandeman (leaandsandeman.co.uk)- Armit Wines (armitwines.co.uk)- Majestic (majestic.co.uk)Wine Direct, if you spent have the amount of time and budget on your marketing and placed it on after sales care and customer service you may have half a decent company.Ref; JOHNSON / Order No.: 616183

winedirect	GB	Wind Direct Feedback	12 February 2018	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Ive been buying from Wine Direct for more than 10 years now and rarely had an issue with delivery. I was made aware of a delay with my recent order and provided regular updates until the order was completed. I have always found the team extremely helpful and the wine prices excellent and hugely competitive on a very wide range of wines. Keep up the great work and superb prices. Best regards. Luke
winedirect	GB	Avoid	12 February 2018	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Avoid! They took the money before the wine was ready to ship, then delayed shipment for weeks with little correspondence. They often do not answer the phone and do not respond to emails. Even the shipping tracking number was invalid. We were very surprised to get our wine, and still feel like we we scammed. We did get our wine in the end but only after we started a dispute with the credit card. (order ref: Wheeler)

winedirect	GB	Good but...	11 February 2018	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	Find ordering from winedirect mostly good but not consistently good  My first order (last year) I had to phone a couple of times to check on progress.  Then a couple of smooth quick deliveries but the most recent delivery (after getting no more than an acknowledgement of my order) required me to send an online query to winedirect after a week, (which wasn’t responded to) followed by a chase up call where a nice man confirmed everything was planned for dispatch (and the updating of my order status was simply a clerical error).  Excellent wines at competitive prices but my request to winedirect is to please keep building customer confidence and be more proactive at keeping your customers updated. Thanks
winedirect	GB	wine not arrived- avoid this company	08 February 2018	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Wine direct took 10 days, and nothing has happened with my order. I spoke to a member of  staff after a week, who assured me the order would be here on time. Unsurprisingly, it didn't arrive.

winedirect	GB	Christmas wine	05 February 2018	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	I ordered wine to send out for Christmas on 6th December and received it on 22nd December. I asked for information about a delivery day numerous times via phone and email, only to receive the same answer 'We will get back to you', which of course none did. I ended up having to buy other wine (from Majestic), in order to send it in time.Plus, a case received was of a completely different wine. I phoned up in early January to say this, and nothing happened. I phoned again the other day and I received the correct wine within the day. If only that had happened for Christmas...I wished there had been some kind of advert on the website to say that the company was in the middle of changing warehouse and there would have been delays with the orders. I don't think I will use the website again.

I can only speak for my experience but also used Winedirect on 3 or 4 previous occasions and never any problem receiving my wines within around a week of order placement.  There was one occasion where a single wine was unavailable and that bottle was refunded without issue.  In fairness the previous orders were more than 12 months ago and it seems that Winedirect have had some issues coping with volume of business ahead of Christmas.  I hope that this is properly addressed for all those with genuine cause for complaint,  but I do not have an impression that Winedirect are deliberately dishonest or in any way fraudulent in their dealings.
winedirect	GB	Terrible website with no accountability …	26 January 2018	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Terrible website with no accountability and a non-existent customer service. Ordered 6 bottles of wine more than a week ago and paid for all 6 bottles. Expected delivery time is 1-2 days but the order never came. Submitted an online form on Wine Direct’s website, emailed them four times across the week and called them repeatedly but have not received any updates. Will be taking further action if the company still refuses to get back to me

winedirect	ZA	Unacceptable	23 January 2018	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Unfortunately, this is not a Company I would like to order from in the future. The mark of a well run Company is how they respond to issues and provide adequate communication to their clients. Wine Direct clearly has no idea how to provide acceptable Customer Service.
winedirect	FI	Total SCAM	23 January 2018	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Total crap, don't order anything from them! Made my order on 9th of December with international delivery that they advertised on their website. There was no info about any delivery delays for the items that I ordered and I was unable to get any response to my calls/emails/chat requests. They also promise on their site to contact if the delivery time is expected to be delayed more than 14 days. That never happened.Then suddenly on 5th of January I received APC overnight tracking code for domestic deliveries that is not valid for international deliveries without any further explanation etc.Now it's 23rd of January and I have tried to get in to touch with them multiple times in different channels without any luck. Now I'll call to my credit card company and report the scam.Don't order anything from them unless you want to play Russian roulette with your money and nerves.

My relative received the delivery of the wine at the time you told me it would arrive. My relative was very pleased with the present and it arrived safely. Very happy with your service and level of communication about the delivery. All communication was comprehensive. Reassuring as I am in Australia sending a present to the UK. Thanks. I will use your service again.
winedirect	GB	Still hideous	17 January 2018	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Updating from our previous post... it has arrived at the point now where our emails and calls are willfully ignored (but guests from our wedding have their emails answered). To top it off, Tony - customer services - has blocked calls from my mobile phone. The wedding was on 28th October - we still don't have all of the wine that our guests gifted to us and it sadly looks like we're never going to get it.
winedirect	GB	Missing delivery now fixed	16 January 2018	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	Feb: 2018:Footnote to earlier comments - owners of WD are working hard to restore customer confidence by clearing rhe backlog of unfulfilled orders - in my case with a personal delivery by one of the owners.  Given what I've now experiencd, I hope that they can get back on track for all their customers - starting with proper communications and replies to messages/emails.  So, thank you WD, all sorted.---------------------------------------------Jan 2018:I'm really disappointed that I have to add my sense of despair with winedirect to the comments that have been left by so many other people.  Order received second week in January but sadly missing several bottles -  emails and phone messages have failed to get any feedback from the company so I fear that I have been ripped off for about £40 worth of wine that was ordered but is unlikely to be received.Avoid.
winedirect	GB	One star for this company is being …Awful awful company	16 January 2018	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	One star for this company is being generous!! They are the worst company I’ve ever had the misfortune to deal with! Ordered wine 30th November.. missing 11 bottles still. You NEVER get through to customer service. No one ever returns your call. Emails are only answered very occasionally. We have been promised delivery several times... nothing has appeared. They are con merchants in my opinion. I will now instruct my credit card company to claim money back! My advice to anyone thinking about ordering from them... DON’T!!!Added 8/2/18Also don’t fall for the ‘despatched’ email! I imagine that is because my credit card company has clawed money back. Bunch of charlatans!!!Jeez never use this company.

Ordered on the 5th Jan arrived on the 15th Jan. Got an email from DPD on the 13th advising me the wine would be delivered.  This could all be due to a very busy Christmas trading?

winedirect	GB	I buy from a variety of sellers......	13 January 2018	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	I buy from a variety of sellers. Winedirect are by far the worst to deal with from a customer care perspective. It is almost impossible to get through to them by phone. You end up leaving endless messages and sending many emails before you get a reply. I have not had any issues with the wine when it’s been delivered, but the level of communication is awful. If you order from these guys, don’t expect quick delivery or a quick response to any queries.
winedirect	GB	DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY	13 January 2018	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Wish I had read the reviews here before ordering because clearly Winedirect has not improved their service at all.Ordered two bottles of champagne on 6th January. Two bottles turned up but, despite me checking the boxes saying no substitutes, they have sent me a completely different vintage. Tried to call them on the phone 3 times and was only ever able to leave a voicemail. Also contacted them via their website. Nobody has come back to me. Have now raised a dispute with the credit card company. If Winedirect want their champagne back they are going to have to come and collect it because I am not paying the return postage.

winedirect	GB	Not satisfied	13 January 2018	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	Not very satisfied. Placed an order but decided to cancel my choice within about an hour, in favour of some different wines. No option to cancel on the website so sent a online message. 4 days later and still no response. Tried their phone 5 times but no one ever answers or returns your call. Wine arrived promptly and I debated whether to reject the DPD delivery but decided I would probably never get my money back so kept both orders. Meaning an additional spend of £60. Very frustrating. I would source your wine somewhere else.
winedirect	GB	Better communication needed.	12 January 2018	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	What I found a bit disappointing was that they didn’t have the wine in stock- but it wasn’t until I got in contact to get an ETA for the delivery that someone got in contact with me regarding the lack of stock and seeing if I was happy with the suggested replacement. I checked my junk emailed regularly also and there was no mail in there regarding my order. I wouldn’t have minded but payment had been taken and the money had been withdrawn from my bank account and I was just not informed of anythingOnce they had made contact after I got in contact and made the substitution delivery was extremely quick and the product I received is also very good. I work in wine also and appreciate how these things happen but communication quickly will help you solve a lot of issues before they arise.

winedirect	GB	The worst online supplier I've ever encountered!	29 December 2017	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I totally agree with everyone who has given Wine Direct one star. But One Star (= Poor) doesn’t begin to describe WD’s service accurately. It should be possible to give Zero Stars (= Dreadful).On December 12 I ordered 12 bottles of wine from this company. On December 14 I received an email saying my order was ‘processing’. Since then I have been unable to contact the company, either by voicemail (they never answer the telephone) or by email. The wine was a Christmas present: on December 21 I ordered a replacement crate from Laithwaites, who guaranteed Christmas delivery; they delivered on December 23. No problems. Excellent service. I am now in the process of reclaiming my WD credit card payment, under S. 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974. My credit card provider is being helpful.Wine Direct appears to be the most incompetent, useless outfit I ever dealt with. How they can continue trading is a mystery.

Have since not responded to 3 emails and 1 phone call to so-called ""customer services"".  Have filed a complaint with my credit card company.  I have been  buying wine on-line for 15yrs and have never had such an appalling experience.  Never again.  For your own sanity heed my advice !"
winedirect	GB	DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!!!	28 December 2017	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I wish I had the previous bad reviews. This company is terrible, they lie on the phone saying your order is on the way, but it’s not. It’s now the 28th December and our Xmas wine has not been delivered, despite all the guarantees. We ordered a substantial amount, as a consequence I feel so cheated and such an idiot for using them. I’m beginning to wonder whether it’s a scam.
winedirect	GB	AVOID AT ALL COSTS - CUSTOMER SERVICES WILLING TO LIE!	28 December 2017	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Ordered wine for Christmas on 10th December for guaranteed Christmas delivery. Payment promptly taken on the 10th December. Phoned twice last week and was told my delivery was guaranteed by Christmas. Was also told that all the office staff were in the warehouse ensuring orders were delivered by Christmas. We are now post Christmas and still have not got my guaranteed wine. I have tried getting in touch my phone, email and their IM service and have got no reply. Avoid this company as their customer service is abysmal.....lying to customers.....seriously.
winedirect	GB	First time I've used a wine/alcohol delivery company …	28 December 2017	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	First time I've used a wine delivery company and I was very pleased with this - It was a late decision to buy a Christmas present for a colleague and it was delivered on time with great communication. As for the wines, I am no expert and it was a bit of a gamble but the recipient was really impressed....and he would have told me if this had not been the case!!So yes, I would use WIneDirect again. Only minor comment was that I didn't find what I was looking for first time round - I nearly bought an empty box! This was more down to my lack of ability I think.
winedirect	GB	I really wish I had checked Trustpilot …	27 December 2017	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I really wish I had checked Trustpilot before ordering - a wee lesson learned.  If you are reading this before placing an order don't make the same mistake I did.Placed an order for a half-case as a Christmas present for my dad, as per the Christmas ordering guide assumed it would be delivered within the time frame specified.  Nope.  So had to get a plan B present on Christmas Eve.The courier did attempt to deliver it today but as I had already cancelled the order and it was no longer needed I refused the delivery.I thought I would give WineDirect a chance to rectify the problem before reviewing, but as their customer services are shut till the New Year and they sent an automated email on Christmas Day begging for a good review (the only communication received with any substance) I have decided to write this.Maybe for future it is advised that Wine Direct keep their customer services open during the festive period seeing as many people seem to have problems...

winedirect	NZ	Will not use this service again	25 December 2017	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	So-called overnight service took several days. Lack of information about actual delivery (still not sure whether the wine actually was delivered). Overall, too much reliance on automated processes and not enough on human eyeball.
winedirect	GB	Dispatched and delivered in time	24 December 2017	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Dispatched and delivered in time. This is the only company to supply the champagne I like. Good communication about receiving the order and when it would be delivered. I will be using them again.

winedirect	GB	Noel and No-wine!	23 December 2017	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Ordered 6 whites and 6 reds on 6th December, reds received eventually on 21st December after chasing up twice. No whites as of 23rd December and unable to speak to customer services since 21st. No communication from WD warning of delays, in fact, no communication at all. A Shame as I have ordered in the past without problems and they have some good wines. Very poor customer service. Hopefully the whites will arrive in time for Christmas 2018!
winedirect	GB	NOT HAPPY!!	23 December 2017	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	We live in Portugal but spend Christmas in the UK. Ordered from Wine Direct last year and everything was fine. Decided to order again as we are staying in a very remote area and isn't so easy to nip to the local off-licence.Was getting worried after a week as the order still show as being processed. Called and was told the order will arrive by 22 Dec, guaranteed!!Checked the status on the 21st - Still processing - Call straight to answerphone.Friday 23rd afternoon - Guess what, no delivery!! Called again and goes to answerphone.Guess the owner is away on holiday enjoying some nice wine......Not happy - Want a refund.Update: I received a refund after a few months. Fair play.
winedirect	GB	Another poor effort by Wine Direct	22 December 2017	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Well this is the 3rd time they have let me down. I placed multiple orders on the 13th December 2017 with Wine Direct, Oddbins, Majestic and Drinks Direct. DD delivered in 2 days, Oddbins and Majestic in 5 days. As usual I had to follow up with Wine Direct to get an update - I was told my order would definetly be delivered on Friday 22 Dec  -  another Wine Direct no show. Basically this guy has a nice website with very little stock on the shelf, incredibly poor supply chain and no order tracking capability.

winedirect	GB	This company has some very good wines …	22 December 2017	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	This company has some very good wines at some of the best prices that you can find anywhere in the UK.I have been ordering from them for about 12 years now and I am always satisfied.Now, it is true that in the past they were mishaps with delivery where it was unduly delayed, because the wines could not be sourced and that was not communicated properly.This time delivery was prompt, taking into consideration it was the busy pre-Xmas week: ordered on Monday night, received on Thursday.I believe it is a small company that gets swamped by orders pre-Xmas, hence the occasional problems. If they fix this, I would rate 5*

Order has been despatched to my work address, which is now closed for Xmas so wine will not arrive in time. So a waste of time and no wine for Xmas.

winedirect	GB	Overly bad experience so-far albeit Christmas time	21 December 2017	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Edit:Ordered on 5th December : 7 bottles of rather expensive wine.Friday 17:00pm - No delivery still. I phoned and got through twice to be interrupted whilst asking for more info and told “it’ll definitely be with you by Christmas” I simply wanted to know whether it’s because I hadchosen “to not have any Wine Substitutions / vtg changes”Another upsetting and insulting part for me is the online delivery updates - the money shot out of my account reasonably fast, but it’s been on “acknowledged” for a long while with no change. Surely the online system should be more up to date than this - it’s a huge company with a 10+ year history...The parents and distant family now go without their gifts 2 days before Christmas.I can not reach anybody the last 3 days via email, phone, contact form , nothing. Not even a small note “It’s fine” - “You won’t recieve till Xmas due to ****”..... zilch. No communication. :(Feeling rubbish + disappointed... thanks a lot WineDirect.

This is just unacceptable service and I cannot even cancel my order through their ""call answering service"".  This is the first time I have left a bad review as I agree with a previous poster to just get on with things and not custom the business again.  However this is so appalling I felt the need to warn others.I will be contacting my credit card company and will be informing the Advertising Standards Authority and the Financial Conduct Ombudsman to investigate this sham.My intention (and I am sure that others are probably doing the same) is to force the Director on the Companies House profile for this business to feel the same pain that he has inflicted on his customers."
winedirect	GB	The Worst Online Customer Service EVER	20 December 2017	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	UPDATE 03/01/2018: Wine finally turned up on 2nd January. One bottle was substituted with no communication.  I'd already bought my husband another Christmas present. This company should really stop trading until they have learned how to operate an e-commerce business properly.  My first and last order with them.UPDATE 23/12/17.  NO WINE, NO EMAIL, NO PHONE CALL.  If you are thinking of ordering please take my advice save yourself the stress and don’t bother.  Ordered £58 for wine for Christmas day on the 13th of December, special wine that was served the day we got married, our 1st Christmas together a special gift to my husband.  Called them 3 times since Monday told same story each time, they are an overflow team and a message is being passed on for someone to update me, I have heard absolutely nothing. They say all orders will be dispatched by the 22nd, no one seems to know where orders are in their process, so what are we supposed to do sit in all Saturday waiting on it arriving.  Completely unacceptable.  I'm actually questioning if this is a genuine company.

winedirect	GB	Do not use Wine Direct!	19 December 2017	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Ordered my 1 case of wine on the 03/12/17 and was told it would be with me in 5-7 days, it's not and i've heard absolutely nothing from them. Just the same as most people on here I have emailed, phoned, tried the direct chat but had absolutely no contact except with the overflow call centre who told me to keep messaging. I've never left a bad review as I believe if you receive a bad experience then don't use the service again and be done with it. With Wine Direct though,  I felt compelled to write about just how bad it was so no one else suffers. I need to try and get a refund now. Disgraceful customer service.Update: Requested a cashback charge from my bank for the money paid and surprisingly I received my wine 3 days later on the 22nd of December. I appreciated the fact it was sent but I was missing a bottle and still haven't been told if I will receive it at a later date or if I will get a refund. Nice wine though.
winedirect	GB	Came good in the end	19 December 2017	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	UPDATE: The wine has arrived today - correct vintage and well packed. Thank you WineDirect. I have therefore increased the rating to 3 stars. It is a pity the experience was made more stressful by such poor communication. The website needs to be clearer about the potential for delivery delays and customer call handling needs to be drastically improved. Either Wine Direct has ceased trading or it is being run with an unimaginable level of incompetence.As with other posters, I ordered 'in stock' wine and received and heard absolutely nothing. No response to emails or messages left with the overflow call centre. As the quoted delivery window has now passed I will be contacting my credit card company to request a refund.I fully accept that delays and mistakes happen, but ignoring customers persistently when they have paid for a service is completely unacceptable. Shameful.
winedirect	GB	Let down by the carrier	19 December 2017	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	I'd used Wine Direct in the past and had no problems.  Not many companies can supply the wine I'd wanted, so I was delighted that once again they were able to oblige.  My order was processed efficiently and confirmation sent that the wine was on its way.HOWEVER, the carrier they used were dreadful.  We were away for a few days when the delivery was made.  In that case, the wine was supposed to have been left in a (previously notified) dry, safe place.  Yet it was left outside, on the ground, by the side of where they were supposed to have left it.  It rained whilst we were away, so the cardboard case was quite soggy by the time we got home.  Fortunately the wine was very well packaged inside the carton and not damaged.  It could, of course, also have been stolen during the 3 days it sat there.Please review your carrier

winedirect	GB	stressful wine buying dot com	15 December 2017	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	You will find a wine or two that you like. You will see its at a good price with WineDirect whom you will think you know of as a trusted, large company- perhaps that you used previously- but not realise that, in fact, somebody(s) took over the name in September 2017. You will order your wine- with varying degrees of difficulty because even the website ordering system is no longer guaranteed competent. You will then hear nothing and no wine will arrive with you. You will try and contact the direct phone number of the person who sold you your wine. It will ring for two seconds and then say that its not been possible to connect you. You will call the general number but get put through to an overflow call centre who will tell you that someone from WineDirect will call you back. They never will. You will find that the head office is impossible to get hold of despite a registered address at Buckingham House, Myrtle Lane, Billingshurst, RH14 9SG.  You will then get suspicious and refer to a review site like Trustpilot. You will then lift your hand, put it towards your forehead and smack the latter with the former.  A Post Script. Just as I was about to push the button on this review I received a call from WineDirect, which was prompted by some digging around that I had done prior to venting frustration on the keyboard. Inadvertently but thankfully my poking about had put the proverbial cat amongst the proverbial pigeons. I am assured, and I think re-assured, that this is not a scam but there are marked logistical issues and my wine should be with me, albeit a different vintage, prior to Christmas. Watch this space. For now I have raised the 1 star rating to 2.
winedirect	GB	I wish I had read some of these reviews …	15 December 2017	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I wish I had read some of these reviews before I placed an order.  I have tried unsuccessfully to speak with someone about my order which was placed on December 8th, I have been put to voicemail, cut off and told several times that no-one is available and no-one has either emailed me or phoned me back.  This is not customer service on any level.  I have now said I want the order cancelled and I have no doubt I will be going through a similar palaver to get my money back (if at all).  If I treated our customers like this we wouldn't have any left.Update: December 21st the wine arrived yesterday completely out of the blue - for which I'm grateful.   I don't understand why this company has got itself into this mess and I hope the rest of you who don't have your wine get yours in the end.

Before I placed the order I had attempted to contact Customer Services on several occasions and eventually left a voicemail as I wanted to confirm that I would receive the wine in a timely manner.   I then placed the order.The following day still having had no contact from customer services I called again trying to confirm a delivery and did speak to a member of the team who confirmed that I would receive an email.  No communication was received.The day I had wanted to receive a delivery I started to contact Winedirect  at 09:00 in the morning by telephone and email and eventually resorted to the Chat online.  I eventually received contact at 16:05 with apologies for missing my emails.   And with a solution which meant I would receive my delivery in the early afternoon on the day of the event.  Happy Days ... or so it would seem ...At 16:05 on the day of the party bearing in mind communication was my issue - I had received no communication from the company and no wine either I try again to obtain information.   Eventually the delivery was made about 16:35 and at 17:31 I received an email to confirm that the delivery had been made.  The event started at 19:00This has to be one of the most unnecessarily stressful experiences I have been through in order to get wine delivered.  There are hundreds of wine companies out there in order for you to compete with the others you need to up the game on the communication stakes.The wine was lovely and good value for money.  It would be difficult for me to recommend to anyone else or to use the company again.  A great pity.

I have also sent 3 x Emails with all the details over a period of 2 weeks and to this date have received no contact from WineDirect . The wine has not yet been delivered even though the intended UK recipient has called 3 times. What the hell do I have to do to get some sort of Customer Service. I am in Australia and feeling very frustrated.

Nobody has ever called me back and not responded to e-mails etc. This bottle of wine was a gift for 14th December and in retrospect, I wish I had looked at the honest reviews online (Not just trust pilot but everywhere else......terrible reviews) I probably could have flown to South Africa and got this wine myself in less time. The money came out of my account a lot swifter than their service. (How convenient) I feel like my money has been taken and I will never get any response or indeed, like many other people, never get my wine! Shame on you WineDirect!!!!UPDATE.......Monday 18th December 2017.........Despite numerous phonecalls to customer service (who on every occasion have told me somebody will be in touch and never have) and an e-mail to Daniel at fermentation ltd (Who seems to respond on here, but not to e-mails) I have now taken this up with my bank who are working on returning the money to me and opening a case against winedirect!!!I am absolutely appalled that this has been such a stressful situation that could have been easily solved with one phonecall from wine direct!!
winedirect	GB	I advise against placing any …	08 December 2017	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	"I advise against placing any orders,with this company ,my experience is like others who have posted reviews, all negative with one exception. My Amex card has been debited ,however I have not received any information re despatch ,I have had no answers to request for update communicated through their on line function. On calling I was told ""The Team"" were unavailable and they could not advise when someone would be available to talk to me.Looked the company up on company house records ,and their capitalisation, is almost zero.Buyer beware springs to mindDunroamin"
winedirect	GB	Teribble customer service.	07 December 2017	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I have to agree with the majority of reviews here. After placing an order on Tuesday, the status of my order hasn’t changed form ‘acknowledged’. I called today (4 times) to simply enquire as to an estimated delivery date, and was told a member of customer services would return my call each time. What an appalling level of customer service, leaving a negative review should not be the only effective way to make contact with a company. Also I can’t help but notice that the only speedy part of the process so far is the money leaving my account.
winedirect	GB	Do not use this company	07 December 2017	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Winedirect do not deliver according to their website. They do not reply to phone calls nor respond to emails! Where is my wine, will it ever arrive or will get my money back! I am waiting.........Tony Abreu from Winedirect made contact with me shortly after the above posting and promised to resolve my issue with the delivery.He did and the wine has just been delivered, 27 hours later. They can provide the service after all.Thank you Tony
winedirect	GB	APPALLING - DONT ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY.	06 December 2017	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	DONT ORDER WINE FROM THIS COMPANY.If only I had read the other reviews before ordering.Absolutely APPALLING service. wine ordered on 25/11/17, still hasnt been delivered as of 6/12/17.Rang the twice comapny on Monday this week, got put through to 'cutomer services' which isnt, but is actually the receptionist who was completley unhelpful, said no one was available in 'sales' so I said i'll hold, told me I couldnt as they didnt have a hold facility. Failed to ring me back (twice) and now all I get is an answer phone.How do companies like this stay in existence.I repeat - DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY

winedirect	US	Very poor	29 November 2017	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I ordered 2 bottles for my daughter-in-law's birthday, allowing 2 weeks for delivery. After a month there was nothing and I was not able to contact them on the 'phone.I got my Bank involved as I'd paid with a debit card. I don't know if the Bank actually contacted them but within a day or two the wine was delivered and I called-off my Bank's fraud investigators.Don't need hassle like that. She got the wine a month late and I spent hours contacting & writing down what had happened for the Fraud people. Never again.

winedirect	GB	wine direct  avoid	28 November 2017	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	wine direct fermentation limited is a  FRAUD. DO NOT ORDER FROM THEM a scam. They keep saying there is no one who can help about my order  as everyone is busy. Yes, very busy scamming people. Avoid at all costs.Having said that, I now stand corrected. Eventually they did contact me,  and gave me a refund promptly. However the order was not cancelled at the depot side so my wines arrived. I called them back and paid my order, which I was happy to do as I wanted the wine in the first place. Since they are restructuring they are a little slow in response but hopefully things will be streamlined in the future.
winedirect	GB	These people are either incompetent or …	22 November 2017	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	These people are either incompetent or complete theives.  They have failed to deliver £1000 of wine, and it is impossible to get anyone on the phone in customer service!
winedirect	GB	Give them a chance	21 November 2017	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	I ordered some Fine wine at a very good price that  did not arrive within the time frame specified. I contacted customer services and raised the issue, they said the order was still pending which did concern me slightly having read the other reviews. I waited another week and was about to stop payment and the wine arrived. It is a very good vintage and better than expected,I cannot fault the product. I agree the company has some customer service issues but with a little patience they do deliver, I'd recommend giving them a chance.
winedirect	GB	Avoid at all costs	17 November 2017	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	"Avoid at all costs. As the previous reviewer said they take your money from your card for ""in stock"" wine. After 4 months I had still not received it despite assurances. Then after several calls/emails I was assured that they would pay the money back to my account as they could not return the money to my card ""as they were a new company"". On investigation this is nonsense as Wine Direct Intl went into liquidation in Feb 2017 and I paid by card in June 2017. I gave them my bank details to repay but surprise surprise no money sent. Dissemblers like this should be drummed out of any business."
winedirect	GB	Cannot believe this company is still …	07 November 2017	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Cannot believe this company is still trading, does not deserve 1 star. Placed order for ‘in stock’ wines stating no substitutions on wine or vintage. Money was taken from my credit card immediately. After a week I had not received my order, it was still flagged as processing, I called the company numerous times selecting either 1 for customer services or 2 for accounts but only ever spoke to ‘receptionists’ who passed my details on so someone could call me back. No one did. By day 3 I emailed the company demanding a refund, again no one had the courtesy to speak to me, not even the ‘head man’, Andrew, who was always going to call me shortly when I kept calling. After over 1 week and more than 30 calls I only ever spoke to receptionists and no one returned my calls. My perseverance has paid off as I have today seen the refund back on my credit card.Note: phones answered as Fermentation Limited which has Andrew Birtley named as a director perhaps the same Andrew Birtley who was director of Wine Direct International Limited now in liquidation (info from Companies House).
winedirect	GB	I ordered a bottle of Baron L from …	28 October 2017	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I ordered a bottle of Baron L from Ladoucette  for my wine tasting evening at a price of £56!!, which is probably the best Pouilly fume in the world and it tasted like a cheap sauvignon blanc.... this was confirmed in the blind tasting by all seven of the guys in the tasting..... I emailed them asking if the bottle was directly bought by them or from a third party and that i wasn't angling for a refund, both using their internal email service as well as sending one to their sales department. NEVER HEARD A WORD..... Given the fame of the wine and the lack of a response, I can only assume it wasn't a direct purchase and as such i can only pass the information on to see if any one else has experienced anything similar....
winedirect	GB	Very disappointed in this company	22 October 2017	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Very disappointed in this company. I ordered 3 bottles of wine on 25th September, understanding that sometimes some wines may be limited in stock and agreeing to a different vintage (although not a different wine) if the one I wanted wasn't available. The order was acknowledged and the money taken. That's it. I've left 4 voicemail messages, none of which have been responded to, 3 emails, one of which was rejected and all I've asked is that someone does me the courtesy of a reply to any of those communications, updating me on the current status of my order and requesting a refund if they are unable to fulfil the order. Complete silence. I just want to know what is going on really and wish I'd read the reviews before ordering.I will now have to attempt to reclaim the money paid and I understand this is a long process. Would never use this company again.
winedirect	GB	Fraud!!!	12 October 2017	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Fraud!!!! Avoid!!! I have had the same service as everyone else just reported the company for online fraud!!!!
winedirect	GB	Awful service!	12 October 2017	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Placed an order 7 days ago and I still haven't received anything. They took the money from my instantly.I've called several times but it's always a voicemail. I left a voicemail, sent emails and i have no reply. I have no updates on when I'm going to receive my order! This is the worse service I've ever had! I'll never order from this company! I can't even talk to someone asking for a refund!
winedirect	GB	Hindsight is 20/20 - never again!	10 October 2017	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I really wish I'd consulted Trustpilot before placing my order......My experience echoes numerous other tales of Winedirect woe:*ordered 12 bottles of wine via Winedirect website;*on-line order status showed no activity for over a week; and*no one answered the phone or replied to my emails.My story has a relative happy ending in that eventually, someone DID answer the phone and after several conversations, a refund has now posted to my credit card account.  The full process took just over two weeks, by which time I could have received and consumed wine from various other sources. Still, I count myself lucky having read some of the other reviews of this company.The most perplexing thing about this is why would anyone go through the trouble of setting up a decent website, to entice people into ordering wine that  you clearly are unable or unwilling to deliver?   Apparently, the delivery issues are a result of implementing new warehousing and IT systems.  Hmmmmm....does that prevent customer services from firing off a quick email or a phone call to customers?  Never got to the heart of that issue.Never again!
winedirect	GB	Worst company to deal with	06 October 2017	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Worst company to deal with and service extremely poor-  ordered wine to nearly 300 pound. Still at 1 month no delivery or feedback from e mails. Just apparently a big problem with warehouse but there are far better options.
winedirect	GB	Con you avoid avoid avoid	03 October 2017	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	So poor you can’t belive it. You order then they see if they got it. Three weeks later sorry. It looks cheap because it’s not available.

winedirect	GB	Excellent! No problems here at all!!!	16 August 2017	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I get the feeling this company may be getting a bad deal...After returning from holiday and enjoying a particularly wine I came home and set about finding some to order.  There were three suppliers in U.K.  Wine Direct was the cheapest so I ordered away. After I placed my order I checked the reviews on here and my heart sank. I prepared myself for no wine and a battle with PayPal but instead I have received a fabulous service. The wine was ordered three days ago, the next day I got an email to say it was processing, another to say dispatched and here it is!!! If you read the small print on the website  it does tell you sometimes the wine is out of stock and it could sometimes take two to three weeks to get it but I had no problems at all!
winedirect	GB	wine did not show up, customer service doesn't answer	16 August 2017	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	still has not delivered my wine 3 weeks after placing my order. customer service doesn't answer phone and ignores some emails. no compensation for delay
winedirect	GB	Arrived - just in time, great job.	11 August 2017	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	Finally my call was answered on the 2nd August and from that point the company could not have been more helpful.The two ladies H and M realky stepped up. The wine I ordered was out of stock but was due in within 7 days and I needed the wine as prizes for a golf dsy on the 9th August.H chased the delivery and promised it would arrive on time.Their back order for Ernie Els, The Big Easy, arrived at there warehouse Monday 7th August and my case of 6 bottles was dispatched for next day delivery.Arrived 8th August - so just in time!Very grateful to H and M for keeping me up to date of progress and called to let me know the wine had been signed for, great job!Of course i will recomnend and use Wine Direct again. With customer service like this then things must improve for all.Regards NK
winedirect	GB	Only wish I had read the reviews before …	09 August 2017	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Only wish I had read the reviews before I had placed my order. Order placed 15/5/17 and still no wine and no communication from them. Be aware their telephone line is constantly busy and they do not respond to their contact form so no chance of speaking to them.
winedirect	GB	Very hard work	01 July 2017	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	I cannot comprehend why the folks at Wine Direct have gone through the effort and expense to set up an on-line business. They have created a reasonably good web site that has some interesting wines and relevant information about them. It is inevitable that people will place orders. However, it would appear that they have no intention of fulfilling the orders in a reasonable time-frame or communicating with their clients in any form whatsoever. Once you have made the mistake of placing an order, you get an automated email confirmation and that is when the communication stops. No delivery updates via email, no answer to  phone calls or the line is long term engaged and you are made to feel like an unwanted guests in their home.This, like a lot of other people, was my experience of this company. I did get my wine eventually, but had to create a dispute via Paypal before they took any action and then the wine arrived the next day.I get the impression that the on-line business is somebody's hobby and he or she will do things at their pace and when they want to and they expect the customers to fall in line. If someone needed the income from this business to survive financially, they would most certainly not last very long.
winedirect	GB	Do not use - no wine, no response.	26 June 2017	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I have had the same experience as many others here. Wine ordered on 26 May still not arrived on the 26 June. I have emailed, used the online form and tried calling (no answer). I have now taken the matter up with Amazon Pay to try and obtain a refund.
winedirect	GB	DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY	21 June 2017	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY. They do not even deserve 1 starordered 6 bottled of wine and was not delivered, they do not pick up the phone or answer emails. luckily I paid with BarclayCard and they cancelled the transaction. Wine Direct should be looked into. They are not the #1 wine seller, just a total rip off

winedirect	GB	This Company is corked!! Don't touch it.	08 June 2017	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	This company is absolutely appalling and should not be in business. I placed an order with them and after 2 weeks nothing had arrived. The phone was always engaged or not answered and e-mails were never answeredapart from one where I was told they were trying to source the wine and would contact me on a certain day!! Needless to say I never got a contact.. Fortunately I paid using PayPal and they were great and refunded the payment.Buy from this company at your peril and be warned.
winedirect	GB	no answer to the phone number	08 June 2017	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	no answer to the phone number, no answer to email and still no delivery of wines.  can anyone help?
winedirect	GB	AVOID!	08 May 2017	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I was given a £20 gift voucher for this company as a birthday present. By the time they had charged me delivery plus a fee for not placing a high value order (never heard of this before but they charged £3.50 + vat), I was left with a whole £8 to spend on wine. A week later I'm still waiting for my delivery. Rip off and poor service-AVOID
winedirect	GB	Poor customer service avoid this seller	05 May 2017	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Poor customer service avoid this sellerI bought 2 cases of wine for about £200. All wines were in stock when I placed the order and fully paid for the wines. About 7 days later, I started calling and emailing the company since I didn't hear back nor got any tracking number. No one replied ANY emails and the phone was always BUSY. After 2 weeks of placing the order I started a complaint with PayPal and only then the merchant decided to reply, saying that one of the wines was due in that same day (lucky me) and that they were going to deliver that same day or the next day. Clearly they didn't deliver nor made any attempt. After more than 1 month I still haven't got any wines nor my money back, although the claim at Paypal has just been decided in my favour.I would advise anyone reading this NOT TO BUY via WINEDIRECT. They have incredibly poor customer service, take ages and are not so cheap (I found same or similar wines in other online sellers at same or cheaper prices).
winedirect	GB	Excellent customer service.	25 April 2017	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Having read some of the negative reviews, I thought I would share my positive experience with them. On placing my order, I was given an estimated delivery timescale, which arrived with a day or so to spare. Now admittedly, the wrong case of wine was sent, but they replied immediately to my email (I'm talking within 5 minutes) and set out resolving their error, by re-delivering my correct order, and even having letting me have  a bottle of the wine that was sent in error as a goodwill gesture. Faultless after care customer service. Thank you.
winedirect	GB	I ordered £250 pounds worth of one …	22 April 2017	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	I ordered £250 pounds worth of one particlaur wine; recived an email telling me my order was processing. Three weeks later with no update I try to call, line is always engaged, emailed no response. I then read these reviews and wish I had done before ordering. I raised a Paypal dispute and sent them numerous emails asking for my wine or a refund! No response. My wine did eventually turn up but I ordered 6 bottles of one type of wine and they send me 3, and then 3 of a different one. I don't expect to pay all that money for wine I didn't want! Contact me and ask if your having sourcing problems!! It's not that bloody difficult to keep customers in the loop!!
winedirect	GB	Very Very Disreputable Business	19 April 2017	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Please avoid at all costs, ordered GBP700 of wine for wedding and 3 weeks later the status of the order is still processing.

winedirect	GB	Phew - the order did eventually arrive!	22 December 2016	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	The champagne I ordered did arrive, but unless they fundamentally embrace modern forms of customer support, I wouldn't use them again.  I placed my order on 13th Dec for a party I was hosting on 21st Dec, so there should have been sufficient time for it to arrive in time.As with other reviewers, the worst thing is you just can't call the company - the phone is always off the hook.  So you just don't know what's going on.  I did get one email back from 'Emily' saying that getting the wine to me by the 21st shouldn't be a problem; after that no response to my emails.  Then nothing until a message left on my phone on the 21st saying that the order would be with me on the 22nd and hoping that was OK!  In the meantime I bought more champagne elsewhere as I knew it wasn't going to arrive on time!

winedirect	GB	Went above and beyond	15 October 2016	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I ordered a case of the wine we drank at our wedding in time for our tenth wedding anniversary in September 2016.  I opted to pay via Amazon, which  made me feel more confident. The payment was taken immediately and I heard nothing for about a week. I then phoned to chase and couldnt get through. I got worried.  I kept trying and managed to speak to Andrew. And he was great. They didnt have the wine in stock, but I explained the situation and he found another wholesaler in Scotland who did have a case, and Andrew paid the slightly increased price and next day courier so it arrived on time.  Very pleased and thank you!
winedirect	GB	Never arrived	20 January 2016	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	My order at £106 hasn't arrived after waiting 18 days when it clearly states on there website 5-7 working days.  Avoid like the plague, plenty of other customers have now had this same experience which I have just recently found out.  Sent them various emails asking them what the script is with my order. Guess what..... no reply. Going to get in touch with the credit card company to be reimbursed.

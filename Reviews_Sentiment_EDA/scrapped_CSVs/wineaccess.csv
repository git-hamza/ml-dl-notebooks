wineaccess	US	One of the best selections of old and new world wines from world-class producers	03 December 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	One of the best selections of old and new world wines from world-class producers. Most of these wines are only found in the best wine shops and are not available to those of us living where all you can find is Kim Crawford and grocery store wines. It's true access to great wines across different price points. Over time I have also subscribed to three of their different wine clubs and they deliver a great selection every time.
wineaccess	US	Always amazing	30 June 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Everything I've gotten from Wine Access has been great, and their customer service is always the best!
wineaccess	US	Annoying minor add-on fee	07 October 2022	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	I was about to order wine today when I noticed a minor add-on fee which I take to be the cost of delivery insurance being pasted on to the customer. It reminds me on airline baggage fee. The company would be better served to increase the bottle cost that would be less annoying. I did not place the order.
wineaccess	US	Questionable Quality Control	27 March 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	The wine was delivered as promised, but the supposedly high quality wine was terrible. I purchased several bottles of 2018 Gary Farrell Russian River Chardonnay last fall with the idea of giving them as Christmas gifts. Luckily, I tasted one beforehand and was shocked at how bad it was. I got a hint of the problem when I found a chunk of cork in the bottle that didn't match the cork I removed. Was it recorked because it had leaked? Was it recorked because the wine was replaced with something else? I can't trust a supplier that doesn't check it's product.
wineaccess	US	One of my favorite places to spend…	21 June 2019	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	One of my favorite places to spend money. The wide variety of wines, plus very exceptional surprises like an Alma Rosa chardonnay from Richard Sanford and the great releases of old vine zinfandels from the Santa Rosa area, as well as some great Australian and Argentinian selections continually blow my socks off. I have been a client of yours for over 2 years and have come to continually trust your judgement. Keep 'em coming. Nissler
wineaccess	GB	Good and Reliable Supplier	22 June 2019	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	Reliable although th commentary on some of the wines is a bit hyperbolic. Not every Cabernet from California is truly outstanding. They are in the sales business so fair enough. Tough to find but some reasonably priced Burgundy (say under $100) would be good. The Burgundies I've bought from them, white in particular have been good.
wineaccess	US	I truly appreciate Wine Access	21 June 2019	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I truly appreciate Wine Access.  Wide range of wines offered - many countries, varietals, price points, styles, etc. - wines for aging, wines for immediate consumption.  Great customer service - always responsive and helpful.  Plus, they let ME decide when and how I want my wines shipped - amazing.  Only downside is that my state limits the number of bottles I can have shipped from online retailer, so, waaah, I'm always missing out on wines I'd love to order.
wineaccess	CA	Don't join outside Ontario	06 January 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Wine Access clubs have some great wines, however don't join is you live outside Ontario.  They don't handle shipping well and won't take any responsibility for damage.  I recently had a case of wine delivered frozen.  Half the corks had been pushed out the case was a soggy mess held together in a ball by packing tape.  Wine Access refused to refund or replace the case.
wineaccess	US	Long-time member who has probably…	14 June 2019	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	Long-time member who has probably bought 100 or more cases. Aside from a rare disappointment consistently very good wines at reasonable prices. There are many online wine buying options these days and WineAccess is in the top three for me. Strong recommendation.
wineaccess	US	Wine Access is great!	08 December 2018	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Almost every wine I have bought through Wine Access has been a winner. Great variety of wines especially in the lower price range. Staff has been very helpful when I needed to deal with shipping issues. As I live in a warm climate I appreciate the availability of the special packaging available to protect the wine during warm weather months.
wineaccess	US	Good valued wines seemed to have…	06 December 2018	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	Good valued wines seemed to have disappeared ever since the new snazzy web pages were released.There is no longer a draw for me to buy a case of good wine from WineAccess any more - since I could get just a single bottle of the same wine from K&L locally in the Silicon Valley for about the same case-offer price from WineAccess.
wineaccess	US	We have been Wine Access customers for…	25 February 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	We have been Wine Access customers for several years. We placed an order for a couple cases for a party we are hosting. We needed delivery the week of Feb 20th. There was inclement weather earlier but 2/21-2/25 were clear days. We signed waiver for delivery on 2/25. We called. We confirmed. We have emails.Wine Access lied to us about the delivery. They refused to answer the phone. A terrible customer experience. You cannot count on them to deliver or to tell the truth.
wineaccess	US	I like the main Wine Access offerings…	16 June 2019	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	I like the main Wine Access offerings especially the ease of ordering where I'm already signed in-- slam dunk.  But the wine specialist offerings, there are no large buy signs, just a large amount of text with two underlined words in it.  Then it doesn't go into my account but necessitates signing in.  On several occasions I had difficulty then finding the exact wine I wanted among the other offering that I had to sort thru.
wineaccess	US	I have found many a great deal on an…	15 June 2019	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I have found many a great deal on an amazing variety of wines, including those you cannot find elsewhere at any price because of their many connections with winery owners throughout the world. Plus the convenience of shopping from home is an extra. My experience with Wine Access and their customer service has always been positive. I'm a big fan.
wineaccess	US	The price points and the products are…	11 December 2018	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	The price points and the products are simply terrific.  The delivery process, however, can create anxiety, particularly if you choose, as I did, the UPS delivery option.  Unlike FedEx, UPS will not accept a signature from an adult next door.  It has to be you, the person whose name is on the label.  Short of taking a day off from work, you're stuck with hoping that you know the habits of Brown well enough to be home when s/he comes a-knockin'.Also, I don't understand why I can't get wine delivered here in Texas for four months of the year.  That's a challenge that Wine Access should address as Texans tend to be thirsty.
wineaccess	US	Great wine selections and Excellent Reviews	15 June 2019	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Excellent, informative reviews and great selections make this a favored web site for me as a wine lover. These people could sell ice to Eskimos. I love reading the reviews even if I am not interested in the wine. In addition, if there has been a problem with any order, the fine staff has been more than helpful in taking care of my needs and wishes. Very professional operation.
wineaccess	US	Wine Access: great wines at great prices!	14 June 2019	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Wine Access consistently offers great wines I could not source even remotely locally here in South Central Missouri, and they do it with great pricing and timely, safe shipping and delivery.  On the rare occasions in which there has been some sort of problem they have addressed it promptly and effectively.  On those occasions when I have inquired about the availability of some genre of wine they have replied promptly; later(sometimes much later), when such a wine was available they have contacted me to let me know.  Five stars from me!
wineaccess	US	trustworthy	15 June 2019	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	trustworthy, loyal, helpful, friendly, courteous, kind, ---------, cheerful, thrifty, brave, clean, and reverent (some of you will recognize this as the Boy Scout Oath):the product - only only once in all these years was the wine not even close to the description, and WA warmly and encouragingly credited the full price toward my next purchase. i.e. i can trust the customer service folk to welcome my requests and do their best to accommodate me.  in the 'case' i mentioned, i did not ask for anything... one of the service people contacted me with the credit in response to my review of the wine.
wineaccess	US	After I'd placed the order:  Change request acknowleged, but didn't happen	12 May 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	After I'd placed the order, but well before it was shipped, I asked that the delivery address be changed.  Wine Access claimed that they did so.They didn't.  I stayed home all day to accept delivery on the new date; nope.  I had to chase it to find it.  Finally achieved reception a week later, when I'd returned from my travels.Customer service is non-existent.  Buy elsewhere.  Anywhere else.
wineaccess	US	Wine Access is terrific	21 November 2020	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Wine Access is terrific. Great values on specialty wines and excellent customer service. Daily deal offers for all tastes and price points plus a small online everyday collection. I’ve been a customer for years and will be for years to come.
wineaccess	US	My First Choice For On Line Wine Shopping	26 June 2019	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	Excellent wine reviews. Spot on descriptions of flavors rarely out of alignment with my taste experience. Like the way shipping cost is waved on qualifying bottle quantities or over $125 per order.Deliveries are updated and hot weather delays are communicated as well as options for cool packs to expedite deliveries in warm weather conditions. I have been using wineaccess for years now and love the X4 United Mileage Plus miles as a side perk.
wineaccess	US	Satisfying and Delicious	21 May 2020	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Received my Three Wine Co. Field Blend a few days ago. Upon returning home last evening from watching my grandsons, I had the need to relax. Uncorked my first bottle and was amazed by the aroma bouquet and taste of this wine. I must say it is the first time I have ever been able to say that I could actually taste the raspberry flavor that was claimed to be in the wine. The wine was satisfying and delicious and I definitely will purchase it again and am anxious to try some of your other selections.
wineaccess	US	It really pains me to write this	28 September 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	"It really pains me to write this.  We've done a lot of business with them over the past year or so, and we really found it a great service--until it wasn't.  Still waiting for an order I placed in *JUNE* (it's now October).  Multiple contacts get back it's being held for weather--incredulity is the kind expression for the claim that at no time across four months was there ever a window that would allow delivery.  The claim is that if temp >80F anywhere along route at any time, they hold it--essentially, this means there is no point in doing business with them for at least half the year.  I don't know about anyone else, but that simply doesn't cut it with me.  We deal with a number of vendors and this is the only one that cannot find a way to work around typical summer weather.  Sad, but their position, clearly expressed repeatedly, boils down to ""Oh, well . . ."""
wineaccess	US	Great Company To Do Business With	14 June 2019	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I have been doing business with Wine Access for about two years and I have found them to be very reliable and responsive to any issue, good or bad.  The wines arrive packed well and deliveries are as promised.The wines I have purchased from them have been very good and fairly priced.  I am continuing to do business with Wine Access
wineaccess	US	Excellent Online Wine Store	14 June 2019	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Wine Access is terrific. Great values on specialty wines and excellent customer service. Daily deal offers for all tastes and price points plus a small online everyday collection.  I’ve been a customer for years and will be for years to come.
wineaccess	US	Quality wines	15 June 2019	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	A good place to find quality wines that you might not otherwise be aware of. Their wine experts provide a fairly complete review of the wines available for sale, so if you know your own taste preferences, you are well on your way to making a good choice. The only drawback keeping them from being 5 stars is the limited window of availability of a selection; once you discover a great wine it may not be available for re-order and I struggle to commit to a case of a wine that I have never tried before. I then try to come back to a wine discovered here when the next vintage is available.
wineaccess	US	I'm often satisfied with Wine Access…	22 June 2019	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	I'm often satisfied with Wine Access products and their importance on shipping. If ever in need to request anything special (uncommon), they're willing will consider. I buy wine most often online and find the reward more than the risk.
wineaccess	US	WineAccess is the best online wine purveyor.	22 June 2019	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	WineAccess is in my opinion the best of a pretty good bunch of online wine purveyors. They always respond quickly, whatever the subject is, and are invariably pleasant and professional. The wines have been well stored and handled well. I have had few problems, and they are always (generously) settled to my satisfaction.

Meet to improve packaging material?In addition to long explanation, you may provide shorter reviews to the point. In addition, share your honest evaluations of cost saving to us in comparison to Total Wine, Costco, etc.
wineaccess	US	Not sure what aspect of Wine Access you…I	26 June 2019	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I like Wine Access, but  what do you want me to comment on? Is it maybe a recent order that I started and left without finishing, and then returned to and was able to complete the order?  If so, very efficient - WA quickly traced my interrupted buy and I completed it.  The wine will only arrive in September so can't tell you how it is yet. I cannot afford to buy wines that cost $30+ a bottle, so I especially appreciate WA's advice re wines in the $15-$25 range that are as good as pricier wines made from the same grape.  I also learn something about wine making from their tales of traveling to places where the wine is made that they are promoting this time.
wineaccess	US	Very very good but I suggest you verify with your own research	06 December 2018	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	In my opinion, Wine Access is pne of the top places to find wine--very good selection of wines, many at good to very good prices.  But, as with most all wine retailers, Wine Access hypes their wines pretty heavily.  Some are very good wines at very good prices, but some are over-hyped.  Overall this is a very good site to find good wine bargains, but you should do your own research before you buy.  I check Robert Parker, Vinous, Wine Enthusiast, Wine Spectator and Cellartracker.com for ratings.  To verify the stated best web price, I check wine-searcher.com or other similar price comparison website.  After doing all that, I have found some very buys.  Their shipping and packaging is excellent.
wineaccess	US	I have been a very satisfied customer…	15 June 2019	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I have been a very satisfied customer of Wine Access for over 10 years.No where else do I find better, well written reviews on available wines.I have always felt Wine Access reviews that fit my wine taste are easy to spot and inspire me to pull the order trigger on the wines I know I will enjoy. I highly recommend Wine Access to my all my friends.
wineaccess	US	Best Online Negociant	14 June 2019	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I have placed over 80 orders and I am extremely pleased with the wine I have purchased.      Many times I purchased a small production wine the can't be purchased in the stores and sometimes it is wine that is being sold at a discount that cannot be found any place else.
wineaccess	US	Communication with Wine Access is easy…	14 June 2019	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Communication with Wine Access is easy and they keep you informed.  Never had problems with delivery, billing, etc.  Love that they take the time to give you the story of the wine and the winemakers.  Have tried wines I normally would never know about - only downside is that some of them I would love to reorder are not available.
wineaccess	US	Never received my wines.	31 August 2020	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Never received my wines.I ordered a couple of decent wine bottles online and after 2 weeks I haven't received my wine and haven't received any response to my follow-up email, yet my credit card was charged immediately when I ordered. If you can't fill an order in 2 weeks (or more?) why do you charge people?

wineaccess	US	We have been ordering from Wine Access…	14 June 2019	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	We have been ordering from Wine Access for many years.  The wine quality and value has been first rate.  On one occasion when the wine we ordered was not satisfactory, they refunded the price with no questions asked. Whenever I have called with a question, they have been very helpful and courteous.I did not hesitate to give them my highest rating.
wineaccess	US	Wines ordered are of goodvalue and quality.	15 June 2019	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Wines ordered for the most part are of good value and quality.  Shipping dates are very accurate and packed with cold packs for extreme weather during delivery to protect the wines from over heating.  A very satisfied customer.
wineaccess	US	The wines are high quality finds	14 June 2019	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	The wines are high quality finds, generally well priced, shipped with care in a timely manner and backed with satisfaction guaranteed.  The staff is knowledgeable and very helpful.  Very deserving of this rating.
wineaccess	US	I have found the Wine Access wines I…	21 June 2019	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	I have found the Wine Access wines I have bought to always have a wonderful aroma, taste and finish as well as great prices in all ranges. I love to find those unknown (at least to me) mid priced every day drinking wines. There are times I  Have to wait longer than I’d prefer to receive the wines I’ve ordered.  Know they get concerned with weather as well as waiting on receiving the wines themselves in order to ship. They try very hard to keep in touch with me if there is a delay.
wineaccess	US	Fill your wine rack from this site.	22 June 2019	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Have yet to be disappointed by any of the wines offered through Wine Access. Although pricey, the quality still makes it a good value. Highly recommend Wine Access to all who appreciate fine wine.
wineaccess	US	WA customer	15 June 2019	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I’ve been a customer of WineAccess for about 10 years. My experiences with their service and help have been excellent. Wines are as advertises, with very good provenance, and shipped as planned. In my opinion, this is a quality wine provider.
wineaccess	CA	I have made several purchases through…	22 June 2019	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I have made several purchases through Wine Access during the last several years.  I have found their advice on buying wines very helpful and reasonably accurate relative to my tastes in wine.  What has really been exceptional about Wine Access is their customer service.  This is one of the best businesses I have ever encountered when it comes to adjusting for customer preferences and needs.  This is a great outfit - worthy of any wine buyers attention!
wineaccess	US	I have used WineAccess for nearly 5…	15 June 2019	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I have used WineAccess for nearly 5 years now, and my experience has been uniformly excellent.  Their customer support is outstanding, and the shipped product has always arrived sturdily packaged and in good shape.  Wine descriptions have been consistent, and I have been able to predict which new wines are worth trying for me, based on my taste preferences.  Until recently, my wife and I have been enjoying mostly cabernet sauvignon selections from them, but recently joined their Wine Club as a means of sampling a wider variety of red wines.  We have found that to be a good experience (and it offers a 10% discount on all other wine purchases from WineAccess as a bonus).  I would recommend without any reservation.
wineaccess	US	Generally speaking excellent  - UPDATED	14 June 2019	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	UPDATE:  Customer service is indeed excellent. Contacted me directly and helped me figure out my problem.  However, I still think it would be nice to be able to choose a delivery date - even if after the “designated shipping date”.Generally speaking the wines are interesting and excellent. I’ve had a couple of duds, but customer service has been excellent. My one big gripe is that you don’t know the expected delivery date (customarily several weeks or months out) until you hit “confirm” on the order page. It would be nice if you could see the expected delivery date before paying for the order.
wineaccess	US	Wine Access is an efficient and…	07 December 2018	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	Wine Access is an efficient and effective way to shop for good wine. I think prices are reliably competitive and sometimes really good. More importantly, I have rarely been disappointed in a purchase, and it sure beats having to go shopping.
wineaccess	US	Excellent service and product	14 June 2019	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	My order was processed immediately. Shipping was quick and the wine arrived in pristine condition. My wine was exactly as described and I was provided with excellent notes/production details--even blank tasting notes for my records. I am delighted with Wine Access! Thank you Wine Folly for the recommendation.
wineaccess	US	False Advertising	03 June 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	They say they have free shipping on their site for orders over $120.  However, they don't say that they charge additional for shipping to Hawaii.  No where on its site.  It is false advertising.

Their prices are excellent and customer service is above and beyond what one would hope for. I sing their praises when my guests praise the wines.
wineaccess	US	Wine Access quality online wine experience	22 June 2019	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Wine access offers an opportunity to try wines that are hard to find or otherwise not readily available. Some offerings are mainstream bottles but by and large, unique bottles or regions are presented and usually at favorable prices. The Selection has become very diverse and includes many new and world word options. I particularly like the in depth reviews and write-ups done by the wine access sommeliers which often discuss the history of the label and the skill set/reputation of the winemaker. This allows feeling confident about purchasing wines perhaps you’ve never tried before. It also allow one to feel somewhat “connected” to the wine.  In most cases, their reviews are accurate upon tasting the bottles. Finally, wine access customer service is fantastic! They are very responsive and seem to genuinely care that their customers are fully satisfied. Overall a really solid online wine retail operation.

wineaccess	US	The wine reviews are well written	18 June 2019	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	The wine reviews are well written, and I assume come first hand.  While pricing is competitive, I like that the research on hard to get wines brings out many options.

The customer service staff on the phone have been very helpful. I have recommend Wine Access to others as a great place to buy wine.

wineaccess	US	Great offerings and a good variety	14 June 2019	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	Great offerings and a good variety. Very responsive to unhappy wines and delivery date changes. Summer deliveries are not kept chilled enough and need to be discontinued or technology improved.Cheers

wineaccess	US	Worth investigating	14 June 2019	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	While the wines we've bought haven't all been as good as we hoped given the price, most have lived up to our expectations, and we've been able to buy selections we otherwise wouldn't have found.
wineaccess	US	Very happy Wine Access	14 June 2019	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	We are consistently pleased with Wine Access. The offerings are solid and the descriptions are accurate. The offerings are priced reasonably, and the delivery company respects extremes of heat/cold to make sure that the wines aren't damaged during shipping. Highly recommended.
wineaccess	US	Great Service	31 December 2020	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	"I have purchased wine for over 2 years and always find this firm to be top-notch.  Pricing is reasonable (I compare using wine-searcher.com), they offer free-shipping on 6+ bottles or $120 purchases and customer service has always been second to none.  Please note that their Limited-Time offers can often take 3-4+ weeks for delivery as these are typically special order items.  Your card is charged at time of order but I have never had any issues surrounding delivery.  Their regular offers ship immediately from inventory.  They also offer ""perfect-temp"" packaging which is useful in AZ through May-June, not so much for summer months.  I also have recently joined their wine club which provides the added benefit of getting 10% off on regular orders on top of their normal discounts.  I also really appreciate their tasting notes that they provide with each wine along with some videos on their wine club offerings.  Both of these really bring out how much they care about wine and provide insights one does not typically get about the particular winery or wine being purchased.  I've only been to Napa once in my life but their tasting notes and videos make me feel like I am one of the locals.  On balance, a great company to work with."

wineaccess	US	I only buy from Wine Access and WTSO	14 June 2019	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I only buy from Wine Access and WTSO - free shipping to Virginia. Wine Access has better wines, but I only pay attention to a few expert ratings.

wineaccess	US	Wine Access - Highly Recommended	02 July 2019	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Wine Access provides the opportunity to explore different grapes, different terroir, and different wine makers, than I would otherwise have access to with my local wine merchants.  Wine Access offers knowledge, a personal story of the producer’s connection the art and science of wine making, there is often a discovery narrative.On a retail basis, buying and selling wine, is more than an economic, pragmatic experience.  An interesting story, backed up with an outstanding wine (full of sensory experiences), that can be shared with friends and family, is the fun part of buying from Wine Access. I have been a Wine Access customer for a couple of years now.  I buy in varying quantities; sometimes a single bottle (special purchase) or sometimes buy the case.  The customer support and customer service has always been outstanding.  The pricing of offerings are competitive.  The variety, connections to the wine maker or producing region, expert reviews, convenient purchasing process and the top notch customer service make Wine Access a good sourcing option for anyone interested in exploring the wide world of wine!  I enjoy the opportunity to highly recommend Wine Access to my friends, family, and co-workers.

They offer great wine selections at competitive, if not, below market prices. And when the inevitable corked bottle or delivery exception happens, their service recovery and customer service is outstanding. My only complaint is they are so easy to do business with and their wine selections so attractive that I order too much and end up with too much excess inventory: I guess a nice problem to have.

wineaccess	GB	Good wines Good prices	04 December 2018	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I like wineaccess because they present a broad selection of wines at reasonable prices.    They have introduced me to a winery which has become one of my favorites.  I dealt with a wine store for years who used to find good wines at bargain prices. It relied on the connections of the owner and when he sold, the store was not the same.  wine access  isn’t as good but has the same concept of finding interesting winds at reasonable prices.  I know I save money with them, and they save me the time of looking for wines.If I had one criticism of wineaccess it would be that they tend to be more high-end, with fewer moderately priced options. It would be nice to find an occasional sleeper wine that was 10 bucks or so. I Buy a bunch of wine from wineaccess, and recommend it to my friends.

wineaccess	US	Good, till it wasn’t	04 December 2018	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	I had great experiences with Wine Access, right up till the last one. As I recall, a shipment I ordered was damaged in transit and the shipment was simply scratched. The product was never delivered, and although I was not charged, the wine was no longer available and no replacement of anything comparable was offered. It was just a lousy experience, all in all. I have not ordered since, and I used to be a steady customer.

Delivery is convenient and they will make adjustments if needed. Their customer service is superb.  I never hesitate to buy from them, as I know I can depend on them.

A great way to build a collection although they are light on French wines from Burgundy and Bordeaux.

wineaccess	US	We've been customers of Wine Access for 8 1/2 years.	27 November 2018	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I've been purchasing the majority of the wine we drink at home from Wine Access since I first  became aware of them in May of 2010.  We drink wine daily with dinner, going through a bottle every two days, and most of our purchases are by the case.  Their are two main reasons that we deal with Wine Access, the first one being that their tasting notes are infallible.  Since most of the wines they provide are not mass produced, but boutique wines, it would be hard to confirm their recommendations by any source other than tasting the wine yourself.   I never have even a moment's doubt.  Only one order some six or seven years ago contained wine that was not in perfect condition.  Three of the first 4 bottles which came out of a case had turned.  I let Wine Access know of the problem, and they immediately credited my account for a half case of the purchase with the understanding that if more were bad they'd make up the difference. As it happened, the three bad bottles were the only ones bad in the case, so I ended up ahead of the game.  I can't guarantee how they would handle such a problem today, but I would always expect any solution offered to be completely in favor of the buyer.

wineaccess	US	Long-Time Satisfied Customer	26 November 2018	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I have been buying wine from Wine Access for a number of years.  My price point is $20 and below per bottle.  I have always been very pleased with every wine I have bought (and got some real bargains in the process) and have reordered the next year's vintage of several of the wines when they became available.  I am also very happy with their customer service.  I have had to call to reschedule shipments when something came up that caused us to have to be gone.  There was never a problem doing this.  They also won't ship wine if the temperature is too hot, which I greatly appreciate.  I have also never received a shipment with a broken bottle, which speaks well of their shipping containers and UPS.

Wine is an easy product to hype. Wine Access certainly markets their wine with fervor but they are largely accurate in their representations and have provided genuine value. I probably buy from 8 or 9 online wine retailers. Wine Access is my favorite.

Over the past several years I have ordered at least 20 cases of wine, and never had a delivery problem or needed to send back unsatisfactory wine. Due to changes in my travel schedule, I have had to request delivery date changes and phone calls are always aanswered by knowledgeable people who resolve any issues promptly. Their wine ratings generally include not only their opinions but also those of outside experts. To summarize, I never worry about poor wine or bad service.

I feel that I would add that other star if Wine Access maintained a full inventory of wines rather than the modest inventory you now have. As a former owner of a liquor store, I do understand how much money can be tied up in inventory and how frequently the inventory must be ""turned"" in order to operate profitably. That said, really appreciate the staff. They are always helpful. The site functions flawlessly and the shipments are well=-packaged and timely."

Not one has been anything but very good or better, although in the spirit of complete disclosure some wines won’t be opened for a few years. The variety offered is tremendous. The only slight quibble is the price sometimes is a little high compared to what you can find for the exact same wine from other suppliers, and they don’t price match. But most of the time their prices are either the best you can find or very close.

They work hard to deliver my wine to my house in the same condition it left the winery’s cellars. When there is a snag, they remedy the situation quickly and satisfactorily. When a refund is required, it’s put back on my card within 2-3 days.I enjoy working with their people and they will even just talk ‘wine’ with you when you feel like it. Overall, they are as close to perfect as an internet business enterprise is probably ever going to get!!!

It is my go to place for wine, and I am rarely disappointed. My price point is under $100, most of which is 30-60$ Range. I don’t feel you have to spend the big bucks to satisfy your palate.  Many of the wines below that range have been excellent as well. While I do not do price comparison, WA offers me the opportunity to shop from home, with their suggestions sent to me via email. With the push of a few buttons on my phone , the order is done. They do all the work, and I just enjoy!

wineaccess	US	Wines arrive promptly	09 August 2018	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	Wines arrive promptly, which is good and bad.  It could be improved by holding wine and not shipping in the dead of summer.  I recently received wines that were quite warm, and I suspect they sat on a truck in severe heat while they were shipped.

wineaccess	US	Highly Recommend Wine Access	09 August 2018	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I have recommended Wine Access to a number of people who have subsequently purchased through the site.  Access to great wines at reasonable price points, and small producers to be found nowhere else.  Easy reliable shipping, and timely updates.  Plus, some amazing wines from extremely high end producers when desired (like Pontet Canet).  Easy to purchase (probably too easy).  Perhaps some segmentation by past purchases to send only relevant offers versus every offer would be helpful.  I have cases and cases of wines purchased via Wine Access.

wineaccess	US	What does it say that I now buy 100% of my wine from Wine Access?	08 August 2018	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I've been a customer of Wine Access for approximately eight years. In that span I've gone from ordering occasionally from Wine Acess to buying virtually 100% of my wine from them. Over time I think I have learned how to better use the service and the service has clearly gotten to know me and my tastes better as well, so it is rare these days that I order a wine that I do not thoroughly enjoy.

However, as Wine Access has grown, their service levels at the fulfillment stage have suffered. We’ve had issues with multiple orders this past year, and in one case we never received the case of wine we ordered, even though their system showed it had shipped. By the time it was sorted, the wine was no longer available. We will continue to use Wine Access as our primary source, but we are hoping they fix the issues with their fulfillment warehouse.

wineaccess	US	Do not hesitate to buy from Wine Access	08 August 2018	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I have been purchasing wine from Wine Access for about a decade and I have never been disappointed.  On almost all of my purchases, I had never even tried a particular wine before placing my order.  I have learned to trust the reviews prepared by the experts at Wine Access.  If you know what you like in a wine (body, fruit intensity, acidity, tannins, etc.) then you can rely upon the accurate descriptions provided for each wine offered by Wine Access.  I have already recommended Wine Access to numerous family and friends who are now long-time customers and I have no reservations about enthusiastically recommending Wine Access to anyone who is on the fence about ordering a wine they have never tried.

wineaccess	US	Trustworthy	08 August 2018	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I have found the descriptions and quality assessments to be spot on.  Great unique selections and excellent service and processing.
wineaccess	US	I really like wine access	08 August 2018	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	I really like wine access. However, there are a few issues. First of all, when you read these amazing reviews of wines you are inclined to trust the reviews and make orders. I have found a few of my orders to be a little disappointing. Now, to be fair wine access does have a return policy, But I don’t have time to deal with that. Second of all, sometimes you place an order and it may take a month or more to receive it. Perhaps that is the nature of the business. But I would like to think I could get my wine a little sooner. I am very satisfied with the experience of purchasing wines through their website.
wineaccess	MX	Show delivery dates up front not after purchase commitment!!	08 August 2018	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	Find it problematic to find shipment/delivery date of products ordered without first having to  commit to purchaseMy purchases are date sensitive as to delivery and if not able to have delivery within a certain time window must cancel orderBe much better to advise of expected delivery date up front
wineaccess	US	Very good selection of wines	08 August 2018	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	Very good selection of wines, with the emphasis on American, particularly California wine.  Prices vary considerably when compared to what is available on the wider market.  Sometimes, some great buys come up, other times the offers are higher than what one can find elsewhere, particularly for high end French wines.  Wines bottled under the Chad label have been my favorite for years.  Chad functions as a  Napa negociant, buying the overage from some very elite wineries and bottling it under his own name at half or one-third the price.Shipping has been pretty efficient, though they did run into some problems at the beginning of this year.  They pay attention to the weather and ship in temperature controlled containers.

Service is good and the help is friendly and knowledgeable.  Still very satisfied.

My only annoyance is that I am charged when I order, and generally it takes four to six weeks to get the wine.  That's quite a float.  Overall easy to use.

wineaccess	US	A great source of great wine	08 August 2018	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Wine Access offers a nice range of wine product, particularly from California, often at excellent savings off retail prices. And there are helpful people in their office who you can contact in the event something goes wrong - i’ve done so once because of an order that contained corked bottles, for which I was given credit, and one time when an order must have been misplaced. The vast majority of my many orders with them have, however, been trouble free. I’m a satisfied customer who has been ordering from them for at least eight years.

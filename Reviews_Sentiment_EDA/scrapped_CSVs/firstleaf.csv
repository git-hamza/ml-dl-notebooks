firstleaf	US	This is obviously a money grab/scam	11 September 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	This is obviously a money grab/scam. Horrible customer service, they will continue to charge you despite saying they have cancelled your subscription. I was finally able to get them to stop charging my card (4 months after I have writing that they were cancelling my subscription) by letting them know I was going to contact the BBB.
firstleaf	US	Absolute garbage	27 August 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Absolute garbage, cancelled repeatedly online and still ran the club purchase through. Refused to cancel/refund to the charges account because I wasn’t the first leaf account holder (I’m the spouse and my spouse is at work and unable to call) even when I was able to give them all the requested information (to include account information, the bank name, exact amount, and date the charge was put through)Following Firstleaf response, she tried twice to cancel using the methods you mentioned and just an fyi, that was my card that was used for the charge so….perhaps the card owner should have the capability to cancel the charge????
firstleaf	US	I very much enjoy this wine…	25 June 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I very much enjoy this wine subscription, they don’t just send you a couple of bottles but send you the rights wines using your personal taste profile. After just two shipments almost every wine they send is SPOT ON!
firstleaf	US	First Leaf: Wines are tailored to your ratings…	21 June 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Wines are tailored to your ratings which is true. I have had 5 mos of 98 % great wines from many unusual regions I would never have access to try based on my rating my club selections.
firstleaf	US	Excellent wines	30 April 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Excellent wines.  Great service.  Curated for you, but you can swap out any wines that you may feel unsure of before they are shipped.  Great flexibility on when you receive your wines
firstleaf	US	Happy Camper Club Member	02 April 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I am a club member and get a box every 3 months. I enjoy the surprises sent, but I am also glad that I can preview the box, and make edits. The descriptions provided for the wines as accurate and therefore useful in making swap decisions.I do occasionally take advantage of sales to order non-club shipments. It is nice to stock up a bit on wines from the club order that we really liked.
firstleaf	US	On time delivery as expected	24 April 2023	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	On time delivery as expected, 5 for 6 great choices, however I’m not quite sure how to get a refund for the one horrible bottle. I’ve got to pay more attention to the choices and swaps. Would give 5 stars if there were an app for members,,very inconvenient having to find an old email. One upcoming concern for my scheduled summer deliveries, may have to cancel for these very hot TX summers, fluctuating temps on wine would cause ill effects on them. Will get in touch with a concierge, which by the way is a great convenience!
firstleaf	US	The good and the bad	22 February 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	The three most appreciated characteristics of Firstleaf for me are: 1. knowing the exact shipping dates, 2. being able to alter shipping dates, and 3. the ability to exercise some control over the actual wines to be shipped.Now the negatives: substituting a different wine for one in the upcoming shipment would mean a lot more if the actual substitute was given or (could be chosen) and then a choice could be made between the two. the option of substituting for an unknown wine and then being prevented from going back to the original selection is, quite frankly, a bunch of bull. You can do better!
firstleaf	US	aEnjoying wines including international ones	18 August 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	appreciate the wide variety ad countries  served in our wine selections. Expands my horizons. Joined wine institute back in 1963. Aficcionado of wines ever since. Prefer your gold and some silver award winners greatly. Enjoy some non awarded wines.few haven'tcared for.Didin't know I could call and receive credit for the unfavorite ones(very few(.
firstleaf	US	A great way to increase your wine savvy!	26 November 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I have been able to learn about new wines and try varieties I didn’t know about. I’m gaining a better understanding of my own palate, as well. The information available on wines is super helpful in selecting which wines to try. It takes the guesswork out of wine selection, which has enabled me to be more adventurous.
firstleaf	US	Been a member well over year now and…	08 October 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Been a member well over year now and love variety and has allowed me opportunity to fine tune my taste for certain wine types/areas. Love convenience and price/free shipping. Club is very flexible on delivery/bottle count options. Have fully enjoyed membership and most selections. Especially appreciate the “swap option” as I have learned to hone my favorites!Never planned club plan but well worth every bottle!
firstleaf	US	I love the selection of wines I receive…	09 April 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I love the selection of wines I receive in each shipment. They are from so many different regions and I haven't had one that I haven't totally enjoyed.I have friends who belong to other wine clubs and pay more per bottle than I do with First Leaf. I can't imagine the wine they are receiving is any better than what I am getting.
firstleaf	US	My experience with first leaf has been…	14 March 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	My experience with first leaf has been a very good one. I am not a wine connoisseur, but I certainly do enjoy your various wines and I get great pleasure out of giving bottles to family and friends. I have no suggestions other than to keep up the good work.
firstleaf	US	Subscribing to Firstleaf Fun for a couple years!	01 August 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I've been a Firstleaf subscriber for a couple of years. It's been fun to try out a multitude of different wines from around the world! I've found a few new favorites! It's much easier to get delicious wines by letting the Firstleaf software select them, rather than guessing at bottles at the store. Plus, it feels like a little gift to myself every month. It's fun to open the box to see what's arrived! One additional bonus - Firstleaf costs less than shopping at the wine store!
firstleaf	US	Great Wines, Great Service!	08 April 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I was really surprised how much I enjoyed the wines after taking a brief taste quiz. I was always disappointed with any bottle I have ever picked out from the store. Firstleaf really nailed my tastes, and there hasn't been more than one in all my shipments that I did not really enjoy! Now I can even pick out a good bottle after learning a little about wines from Firstleaf. I enjoy the articles on their website as well.
firstleaf	US	Beautiful wines are in stuck	10 May 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Beautiful wines are in stuck. Each wine with description give me idea of flavors on the beautiful card. GRATE GIFT for special occasion. I love to bake cake and cookies with my trade-mark and wine, people love that, I received big smile. No guess to the wine shop and save time and money. Thank you, grad I'm in Member.
firstleaf	US	I really have no complaints about my…	31 July 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I really have no complaints about my experience. I can honestly say I look forward to my deliveries and with the exception of maybe 2 or 3 bottles, I've enjoyed them all. Unfortunately I'm not the greatest of book keepers to keep track of which I didn't care for and rate them. One suggestion I'd have is when making changes to a wine selected, if the 2nd choice is not something a person would care for, I wish I had the option to go back to the first.
firstleaf	US	Skeptical no more.	13 August 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I thoroughly enjoy my First Leaf experience.  It is a privilege to be a part of a group that truly strives for excellence. I have had very few wines that did not meet my expectations but after rating them thumbs down my experience was only enhanced because of wines more to my liking even those that I normally would shy away from because of the label. Keep up the great work.
firstleaf	US	Join Firstleaf!	09 August 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Enjoy the selections very much!  I don't think that I have ever had the same wine twice and I have been a member coming up on 3 years.  Would definitely recommend the subscription!  I think the pricing is reasonable.  Delicious wines that are affordable of which I compare to my local shops.  Deliveries are always on time and I appreciate the tracking info provided.  So easy to delay and reschedule your shipments.
firstleaf	US	Don’t like a certain kind of wine? Tough…	25 April 2023	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	In spite of the fact that since 2020, without fail and consistently, I have given a Thumbs Down to any Pinot Noir I’ve received from Firstleaf, I continue to get them. It makes me wonder about the veracity of their algorithm.
firstleaf	US	Unmet delivery expectations	30 April 2023	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	Because a shipment of wine requires a signature and ID, it’s essential that you keep the delivery date that you provide. I have to adjust my schedule in order to be home. I had the last order ship on May 1st but it still isn’t here! I have been given at least 3 delivery dates, but none have been met. This is very frustrating to me, enough so that I may consider canceling future orders.
firstleaf	US	Shipping woes led to restock fee	03 May 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	"I chose to try Firstleaf hoping it might be something worth trying. The order went smoothly but quickly ran into roadblocks when FedEx said it was ""undeliverable."" I waited on my porch all day for the shipment and nobody came with it. I then held it at a location and then redirected it to one of the local pick-up spots close by. Fed-Ex chose to ship it back to the sender and I was charged a restocking fee by Firstleaf. When I contacted them, they stated I would not receive my product and they would not refund the restock fee. Terrible experience that spanned about a month."
firstleaf	US	First Leaf is first rate	02 February 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	First Leaf is first rate! They adapt to the customer’s request now your club order can be 12 different bottles instead of 6 x 2. I’m not a wine expert by any means but I am learning through First Leaf. The regular price of $15 per bottle is very reasonable and as a member there are lots of sales where the price is as low as $13. I love First Leaf no more dragging wine home from the store 😂
firstleaf	US	Predatory, as others have described	07 June 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	"As others have described, this is a dishonest and predatory company. The entire experience is designed to make it hard to cancel the membership, despite the claim you can cancel anytime. Signed up for 1 introductory offer, never created an account, so when I went to cancel I received a message stating there was no account associated with my email. But of course the next month I received a credit card charge 3x the amount of the introductory offer, because I did not ""cancel my membership"". Once I found an email to help desk, it turns out the only way to cancel is to send them an email since there is no account set-up."
firstleaf	US	Customer service is great	01 August 2022	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	Customer service is great. I have enjoyed most wines. I have found the ratings have gotten the red wines very customized. The whites on the other hand have consistently fallen flat so much that I have started requesting less. They have become less enjoyable to drink. Love how you can change frequency of shipments and combinations in box. I have recommended first leaf to many friends and it is fascinating to see how our tastes are different.
firstleaf	US	I expect the beat and I found it!	05 May 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	The customer service is second to none! The delivery is fast and accurate but the wine selection is outstanding. By the way, Open Secret is outstanding! Would not consider any other wine club!
firstleaf	US	Great wine club	01 August 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	After tasting one of our newly delivered wines, we liked it enough to order more. Having been in this club for a lot of years, we know you have to move quickly, so we ordered a 12 bottle case. It arrived in just a couple of days. We really enjoy Firstleaf because of the variety of wines we received and they really do seem to tailor our selection according to our ratings of past wine shipments.
firstleaf	US	Convenient and Good Value	31 July 2022	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	I really love the convenience of the wine deliveries and the value Firstleaf brings to us.  The one thing that I think needs to be fixed is the swap feature available when verifying our orders.  I have found that the same wine pops up over and over - meaning that you actually have only one or two actual swaps rather than 6.  This is frustrating.
firstleaf	US	The concept is great	01 August 2022	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	The concept is great and I enjoy being a member.  A couple of items would make the experience better.  Better filtering on the website for finding and selecting wines.  Also, the ability to search my written comments.  A master list of my purchases with the ability to easily select for re-order.  And another improvement would be an option for 24 bottles per month at an even greater savings.
firstleaf	US	Easy Wine Delivery	01 August 2022	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	I love the ease of ordering wine monthly or at intervals of every three or special selections at other times. There are fun sales and bundles often! The prices are very competitive and I don’t have to leave the house. I like that it includes imports and local wines and we can choose between reds, whites, rosé, and sparkling – or a combination. Good quality that I can't find locally. This is just too easy to pass up.
firstleaf	US	Delicious wine delivered at your door  step	19 November 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	My wife and I enjoy a glass of wine on Saturday and Sunday with meals.  It’s also nice to have wine available to serve when family and friends visit.  It’s a pleasure to know you can select the wine you want  both domestic or international or enjoy the wine picked especially for you. And how often  it’s shipped.
firstleaf	US	The experience is generally good	31 July 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	The experience is generally good. Our last concierge was a bit disappointing in that I did not feel as though he was available at times.  Overall the wines and prices have been outstanding! We have a few favorites, and hope to get those fulfilled during orders.
firstleaf	US	Absolutely horrific experience	10 December 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Absolutely horrific experience. The wine arrived 10 days late. I communicated with customer support on 4 separate occasions, to which they told me to just “check the shipping update.” Each day, I was home with an ID ready to sign for the package. Each evening, I’d get an email about how something went wrong with my order. It was frustrating and painful. Then, the box arrived damaged. Go figure.
firstleaf	US	We look forward to our wine shipments…	01 August 2022	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	We look forward to our wine shipments and appreciate the automated deliveries; however, we have received several “repeats” of wine selections. The reason we are members of the club is so that we can learn about and try new wines. When we love a particular selection, we order several. Please tell us how we can avoid the “repeats”.  Thank you!
firstleaf	US	Great subscription service	01 August 2022	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	I love this subscription service. I only wish that, when ordering a box of 12 bottles, you would get 12 DIFFERENT bottles rather than two of each of the six wines. I understand that if you make a phone call each time they will curate 12 different wines, but that is a hassle that personally I think doesn't have to happen.
firstleaf	US	Wines now are only average	26 April 2023	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	I did not get a call before this order.  I did not get to personalize my order.What I am now disappointed in is that when I like a wine, I cannot get it again.When I first joined the club, there were really good cabernet's and red blends available.  Now, they are very average or below average wines. I may not continue my membership.
firstleaf	US	Better Wine Clubs.  Avoid Firstleaf.	06 April 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I've had much better service with WSJWine.com.  They even reach out to you before your scheduled shipment to confirm.  That's topnotch service that Firstleaf needs to learn.  As they say, if you don't take care of your customer, someone else will.  Enjoy your $25 restocking fee Firstleaf.
firstleaf	US	I like getting different wines that I…	19 April 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I like getting different wines that I normally wouldn’t have tried! The fact I can swap out wines or order more is a great feature. I look forward to the next delivery every time!
firstleaf	US	Five Years With No Problems	31 July 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	In five years I have never had a problem with Firstleaf; they have always been responsive to any concerns and extremely helpful. I spend winters in Arizona and summers in Wyoming so I'm constantly changing the shipping address back and forth.  The couple times I was late in doing this and had a club order being shipped to the wrong address, Firstleaf went above and beyond in customer service to get the order recalled and then sent to the proper address.  It's a very professional and outstanding company.
firstleaf	US	Great wine club!	06 August 2022	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	I have been a member for almost 6 years.  I didn’t think I’d last a year!   I have tried so many new wines and various types of wines.   I’ve enjoyed most of the wines I’ve tried from this club.  I like how you can decide how often you want a delivery, and by rating your wines you are offered wines they think you will like.  They recently started offering Wine Concierges and that has really enhanced the membership.  It’s fun “talking wine” with someone who enjoys it as much as you do and can give suggestions, and personalize each order.  I highly recommend this club!
firstleaf	US	Very spot on and if they are not	29 October 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Very spot on and if they are not, they guarantee your money back. We love trying the wines and rating them. It gets us new choices and better results. This is a fun, learning experience and tasteful adventure.
firstleaf	US	Firstleaf is an exceptional wine company!	07 June 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Firstleaf is an exceptional wine company that truly stands out in the crowded world of online wine subscriptions. As a wine enthusiast, I have had the pleasure of experiencing their service firsthand, and I must say, I am thoroughly impressed.Firstleaf sets itself apart by offering a personalized wine selection tailored to individual tastes. Upon signing up, you are prompted to take a brief quiz about your preferences, which helps the company curate a selection of wines specifically suited to your palate. This level of customization ensures that every bottle you receive is a delightful match for your personal preferences.One of the aspects I appreciate most about Firstleaf is the high quality of the wines they offer. They have a team of expert sommeliers who carefully curate a diverse range of wines from around the world. I have been pleasantly surprised by the selection I have received, which includes both well-known vineyards and hidden gems. The wines consistently exhibit excellent craftsmanship, vibrant flavors, and distinct characteristics that showcase the artistry of winemaking.
firstleaf	US	Favorite Reds with a Birthday Perk	21 March 2023	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	As always, it was very easy to order and getting my favorite reds and rose for the summer was perfect.  I would like you to consider allowing members to order a case of their favorite wine at a bundle price.
firstleaf	US	Each box is a surprise.	03 May 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Sometimes it feels like a real gamble when I’m not sure what kind of wine I am receiving. But other times it feels like Christmas! What a great service to have wine delivered at your door. This company really does try to please and it shows in their service.
firstleaf	US	We enjoy the different choices we are…	27 April 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	We enjoy the different choices we are offered each month! Also that I can change what we receive at any time, and also the frequency of deliveries.
firstleaf	US	My January 2022 Order	01 August 2022	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	My January order consisted of wine that were not to my liking.  5 of the 6 bottles received I rated a thumbs down.  The worst was the Nomos Shiraz from Australia.  In contrast, the Orthographic Zinfandel-Petite Shiraz was the best red blend I've ever tasted.  As a result of this experience I have changed my future wine order selection preference to domestic wines only.
firstleaf	US	Customer support is great.	07 May 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Customer support is great.The wines are very good and generally a little cheaper than my state store.Delivery is easier than going to the local store.
firstleaf	US	I continue to get a number of Pinot…	18 April 2023	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	I continue to get a number of Pinot Grigio’s, and Sauvignon Blanc, I’d prefer Chardonnays. This system would not allow me to subsidize one of the above or Chardonnay.  Also, he won’t allow me to replace I want. I don’t want with one that I do you want I have tried before.
firstleaf	US	I get great tasting white wines	03 April 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I get great tasting white wines. Each delivery, I am able to tell if I prefer to switch a wine. I have already expressed my tastes and the wines are chosen for me based on those preferences. I am never disappointed.
firstleaf	US	I am enjoying my club membership very…	31 July 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I am enjoying my club membership very much because;1. Exposure to different vines2. Wide selection of types of wines I like. 3. A discretion of the wines they send in my order and the benfit of swapping out wines I don’t I will like.4 great customer service .

firstleaf	US	The wines are basically good but we get…	17 December 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	The wines are basically good but we get the opportunity to try wines we would not normally experience. For example typically 5 out of 10 wines we really like with another 2-3 being just OK and roughly 2 we don't like.
firstleaf	US	Top Notch Wine Club	31 July 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Firstleaf is by far the best wine club I have tried. The wines are consistently good, and the one time I got a bottle that I didn't care for, they cheerfully refunded me for it. The other thing I really like is that (unlike some other clubs) if you want to reorder a wine that came in a club shipment, it is the same price as you paid originally. All pricing is very reasonable. The shipping is fast and free (for full case orders). I'm very pleased with both the service and the wines.
firstleaf	US	Great wine club overall!!!	05 April 2023	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	"I have liked the wines Firstleaf brought to me in general.  I do wish there could be a few more ""skips"" when picking your next shipment. Finally, the boxes the wines come in are great!  I just wish we could recycle them or get them back to Firstleaf somehow to re-use!!!"
firstleaf	US	2 1/2 years with First Leaf.	10 May 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I joined First Leaf a couple years ago. Love that I can sit in my living room, order wine and have it shipped to my home. Fast service and great prices. Customer service is very helpful and knowledgeable.
firstleaf	US	Good place to get a variety of wines	22 March 2023	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	Good place to get a variety of wines. Prices are reasonable, but some discounts could be more frequent. Their selection of Reds are really good, that's really all we drink!

firstleaf	US	I don’t buy wine from the store anymore!	17 December 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Love the addition of the fine wines & having th concierge service to tailor my deliveries. Makes it so much easier to explore new wines & order based on my tastes.
firstleaf	US	Greater variety in shipment would be great	01 August 2022	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	Service has been excellent. There have been several service disruptions that were promptly attend to and I was satisfied. The experience would be greatly enhanced if Firstleaf were able to ship one or two different wines every delivery or every other delivery. I understand that the variety is dependent on the distribution but recent shipments have featured pretty much the same wines that I have been getting in the past.
firstleaf	US	I’ve truly enjoyed almost all of our…	01 August 2022	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	I’ve truly enjoyed almost all of our deliveries but from time to time we still get a bottle that I have a thumbs down on.I completely understand that this can happen as busy as you folks are
firstleaf	US	Like wine, but leave selections to experts	16 September 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I'm very pleased, not being a wine fanatic it is great to receive a very good selection of wines. I use swaps to tune varieties I prefer and FL selections have been very good.
firstleaf	US	Satisfied Club Member	12 January 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Selections in my club order are matched up to my “ likes” that I had entered on the questionnaire when I first joined. The deliveries have been accurate and timely.
firstleaf	US	I love Firstleaf Wine club	05 October 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I love Firstleaf Wine club.  The wine selections are always good in taste and quality.  The packaging is strong and attractive and the deliveries are always on time.There has not been one bottle of wine that I didn't think was really, really good.  I'm more of a red wine drinker, but the whites are lovely as well.  The option of rating the wines is fun and helpful to insure getting the types of wines you enjoy.  Please try them.  You will not be sorry
firstleaf	US	Like Christmas with every shipment	27 April 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I am able to try so many different wines that I would not have even come in contact with.  I grew up in Ca. so those wines were the only ones I was comfortable with.  My confort zone has expanded.  And I don't have to buy wine every month.  Since I am the only wine drinker in the house, that makes it very convenient.  I can order a variety and it is shipped promptly.  Love this club!
firstleaf	US	Membership is worth it!	31 July 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I have been a member of First Leaf for over 2 years. I have modified my subscription a few times, but have always been happy with my shipments. I really like the sparkling and happy they are now considered for inclusion in the club.

firstleaf	US	Dishonest and Predatory Company. I wish I read reviews before ordering.	09 May 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	"I placed an order at 9pm on a Monday using an first-time customer promo code that offered 12 bottles for $69.90. I woke up at 7:30am the next morning to find that the company had send me another order confirmation email for an order that was supposedly placed in the wee hours of Tuesday morning, this time in the amount of $198.32. I never placed or authorized this order, even though the order page shays, ""you checked out on 5/9/23.""  When I called the company to have them cancel this order, they said that the order was already fulfilled, which means it would have to have happened between 1am and 7am, and that there would be a $25 restocking fee to cancel it. I immediately canceled by membership on the 9th of May, and the membership cancellation page stated that the membership wouldn't be completely cancelled until July. I've never heard of a company that refuses to cancel your membership the very month you initiate the cancellation. This is how the company makes their money, through predatory practices like these."
firstleaf	US	Wonderful exclusive and personal wine…	02 February 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Wonderful exclusive and personal wine selections that are absolutely decadent, delicious, and delightful. Extremely fast shipping and personal options for choice each month are absolutely fantastic! Love it! Thank you for the intro to wines of the world right to my door!
firstleaf	US	We have enjoyed every bottle we opened	03 May 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	We have enjoyed every bottle we opened.  We added two  bottles of white recently, and are very happy with Firstleaf.  My daughter knows more about wine and she knows what we like and she filled out the initial forms.
firstleaf	US	Always decent selection of wine &…	04 November 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Always decent selection of wine & prices are reasonable. I get to try out wine from around the world without having to spend time researching
firstleaf	US	The white wines seem very sweet	03 May 2023	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	The white wines seem very sweet. I ordered a box and they replaced 2 wines with wines I didn’t like.  Also,  the prices on the buying screen and cards don’t match.  (Lots less on the cards).  Seems like u are misrepresenting the actual wine value at the point of sale.  When I first started the values were true market price.
firstleaf	US	Recommended.	31 July 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I've been a member of Firstleaf for two years. I like getting a variety of good wines at good prices.

firstleaf	US	Best Wine Club!	23 April 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I've tried several wine clubs but this is the first time I've absolutely loved everything I received!
firstleaf	US	Started with first leaf early part of…	11 October 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Started with first leaf early part of this year. First order was great, second was decent and then the quality absolutely went down. Initially they would give combination of high rated, expensive wines with some decent rated cheaper wines in the box. That changed to all low rated or even no rated wines, and the price of the wines not any different from what’s on the market. The swaps part is a joke as the options are very limited and most times the same wines in your box. All this aside, the worst part is their customer service. So many better, genuine options out there. This one is absolutely not worth the hassle.

firstleaf	GB	I love firstleaf!!	08 May 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I love firstleaf!!! I have been a member for a while now. I can honestly say it is amazing. So many great tasting wines picked out for me and delivered straight to my door. Does it get any better than that? Now with the coming summer months I was able to switch my reds for whites with ease. Summer comes and we typically drink more white than red. Once fall comes I will add the red back in. All done with ease. Thank you Firstleaf!!!

firstleaf	US	FirstLeaf is a pretty good wine club	19 March 2023	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	FirstLeaf is a pretty good wine club.  Wines are pretty good and their website is top notch.  They send information cards with each shipment and I love that these are also available on the website as a pdf.  The wine packaging is also cool...  Wines are on their sides, not straight up and down so that the corks stay wet.  They allow you to see the wines that will be shipped and you can change them if it's a wine that you may not want.  There are many options... all red, all white, a mix...  6 bottles, 12 bottles, 2 of each, 1 of each.  Lots of choices.  First Leaf is cool and worth the money it costs for a quarterly shipment.

firstleaf	US	bouchonné... delivery failure and customer service letdown	09 July 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I recently had an unsatisfactory experience with this company which I feel compelled to share. I ordered $100 of wine for an event, but despite assurances from FedEx, and spending the duration of the delivery window positioned near to my front door, it never arrived, causing significant inconvenience.I contacted Firstleaf requesting a refund and expressed my concern about their proposed $25 restocking fee, given the circumstances. However, without my consent, they reshipped the wine. This was especially frustrating as they disregarded my request for a refund and unreasonably held me responsible for the initial failed delivery.Overall, I am deeply disappointed with the service received. I encountered mishandled delivery, poor customer service, and seemingly arbitrary fees. Based on my experience, I'd hesitate to recommend this company unless they improve their delivery and customer service processes to prevent future incidents like this.

If I need more I can just log in and make a purchase. I also like when they have the specials for specific cases to add on. I should do a better job of reviewing which ones I love but I haven't really had many I didn't like. I always recommend this wine club to my friends. It's a good deal and a great way to try bottles you can't find in a small town.

firstleaf	US	The nose knows!	31 July 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I receive 12 bottles per month. I enjoy the different wines from different countries. Every  so often I find a wine that is especially good. In the past, I enjoyed the wine and forgot about it. I have since realized that this was stupid. I know keep a list of these special wines so I can order them again.
firstleaf	US	Love the club!	31 July 2022	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	I’ve always had a great experience with Firstleaf. The wines have been wonderful!  My only wish is that you would develop an app (easier than a website) and a better way of grading the wines (instead of just a thumbs up/thumbs down).  Even if it was 1-5 stars were you could differentiate between a good and excellent bottle
firstleaf	US	I love everything about the club	31 July 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I love everything about the club. I get to try new wines that have good, accurate profile descriptions. The product is packaged well and always shows on time. One thing I might suggest, is you roll some organic and low sugar options into your line up. Thanks for everything, Firstleaf is killing it!
firstleaf	US	Happy customer	31 July 2022	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	The delivery process is great, consistent and I love the notifications. I always know when the wine is coming. The international wines are better than the domestic wines on the whole. Just started getting whites. There was a Spanish white wine sent last month that was outstanding!!Keep up the good work😊

firstleaf	US	I really enjoy receiving the wines from…	31 July 2022	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	I really enjoy receiving the wines from all over the world; however, I think there should be an easier way to purchase the wines that have been noted or rated exceptional by the customer.  From my experience, there is no easy way to go back and find the wines that I loved and would want to purchase again.  Another thought is First Leaf should give us a choice to receive a monthly credit if we are for example on monthly shipments and we don’t necessarily want a shipment for various reasons, like maybe I’m already stocked or maybe I’m on vacation or maybe I want to save up for a special occasion.  In summary, i am pretty pleased with the wines.

firstleaf	US	Why ask?	31 July 2022	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	If you choose and swap wines you may not get what you choose. If you check what is going to be shipped, you may get something else. Bottles I did not review do not appear in “to be reviewed.”  I don’t think they really care what you want.

firstleaf	US	I belong to several wine clubs	31 July 2022	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	I belong to several wine clubs, this one is more expensive then the others nut I don’t find them to be better for the extra money.  I was disappointed that a cheese board was offered with a case purchase, but it wasn’t included in every case only a mixed case including reds, roses and champagne.  I can only drink the dry whites due to heartburn.
firstleaf	US	Excellent Service and good Wines	31 July 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I have been a member of First Leaf for a year and a half now. I originally joined as a gift for my husband and planned to stop after a year. We have enjoyed the wines and the service so much we have continued. We only had one issue with delivery and it was a Fed Ex issue which they solved quickly. Making changes, getting advice, ordering extra wines has all been so easy. Keep up the good service.

You can also vote online the wines that you like and don’t like.
firstleaf	US	Nice wines	31 July 2022	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	My general impression is that the wines have been “interesting” and enjoyable… I have had wines I might not have selected from countries that I do not have access to and was continually pleasantly surprised… I feel the pricing is fair and customer service, when I have needed to contact them, is excellent… Shipping has been less that predictable and mildly complicated because of the need to sign for the shipment without a clear sense of delivery time… I remain a member because of the positives and work through the negatives…

I live in an apartment and receiving FedEx orders that require signature has been my biggest problem.  It definitely detracts from the overall experience.  I think FirstLeaf does a good job of providing many different wines to suite customer tastes and a great job with customer service.  I suspect shipping/receiving is the biggest complaint with all mail order wine services…perhaps I’ve gotten too used to the speed and efficiency of Amazon Prime…

You either like the wine or you don’t, which really doesn’t allow for a fair assessment. Some of the wines are just ok or acceptable, though we wouldn’t go out of our way to buy; some are better; and are definitely not to be repeated

It would be nice if when I choose the wines myself I could choose more than 12 of these.  Maybe 36 or 48 of what I like.   It would seem you dent have the large variety of wines you say you do When I go to the different reds there are not a lot of choices.  I have enjoyed all of the wines I received but there are too many duplicates Again when I go back to choose a group of wines I am limited to 12 bottles.    I do like there is no delivery fee on these

Reasonably priced.What I really like is that I get selections I may not usually choose if I'm out on my own wine shopping. So many great wines from all over the world and Firstleaf is the best choice to experience them all!!

Although I am notified of the date of arrival, it varies and requires that I’ll be there all day. Also, I have found that is difficult to change the types of wine that I would like to receive

firstleaf	US	I am glad that Firstleaf entered my life	31 July 2022	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	My sense is that Firstleaf as a company endeavors to make club purchasing and membership as pleasurable and rewarding as possible.  The functioning of the algorithm is a bit of a mystery. The concierges (Lindsay et al) have been kind and helpful. My only disappointments have been that sometimes a favorite label will be out of stock when I want to buy extra; and there have been occasional last-mile home delivery issues (the same could be said of any mail order company). Overall I am glad that Firstleaf entered my life.

It gives me an opportunity to see what wets my palate and tickles my taste buds. So far Bordeaux has been my favorite. It is a good value for the  price and I have enjoyed the experiences of learning about various wines.

firstleaf	US	We’ve been part of the first leaf club…	31 July 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	We’ve been part of the first leaf club for almost a year now. My wife and I enjoy sharing a bottle of wine 2 or 3 times a week. We can honestly say we’ve enjoyed every bottle that’s been chosen for us. It’s been enjoyable to throw our taste experience back and forth about what we taste and which foods a bottle would be best paired with. We do choose more white wines in the summertime and we’ll go back to more reds in fall and winter. We also like the specials that are sent out periodically and have purchased a couple of these as well as our normal order. We were a little skeptical at first, but we’re all in now. We look forward every month to see what gets sent. We’re happy we joined the club.

The only thing I would change is that you often provide really excellent wines for just a short time, and then that wine is no longer available. Plus, the club orders inevitably include new wines that I might not care for. I'd like more reliability and stability in the wine selections.

firstleaf	US	This is a great service with a few…	31 July 2022	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	This is a great service with a few frustrating limitations. One, by rating our wines, we get wines that we generally like but no longer see variety in the selections -- we are very much stuck in a self-reinforcing rut!  Also, we would love to buy more of bottles that we like but the website is so frustrating I have given up on this. I spend the time to thoughtfully fill my basket only to be told that the order can't be filled.  I can't figure out which of the wines are/are not available to correct the problem. The only way I have fixed this is to contact the company and ask someone to fix it which is a hassle.  So I buy extra wine elsewhere.
firstleaf	US	Like a variety of wines with different taste.	31 July 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	We have enjoyed the different wines. Enjoy the reds compared to white but something different is good.

I wasn’t able to get some of the wines I ordered and didn’t get the sale price. However the wines, so far, have all been very good.  The ones I wanted would have been better, though.

I was attempting to swap out a sweet wine for a dry but the only options were coming up in the sweet category. Amanda straightened it out for me but I felt I should have been able to access other wines when swapping. Very insignificant query when the overall Firstleaf experience is 5 Stars, top rated with me!
firstleaf	US	Ordered trial box - Failure in Communication	28 July 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	"Ordered trial box.  Waited 3 weeks for my box to be delivered.  Finally called to see where my order was and it wasn't until then, that they informed me that it was broken in transit.  No one bothered to communicate that to me proactively while I waited patiently and loyally to give company a chance.  Upon communication. Eunice the customer service representative was very apologetic, agreed to refund me, and even replace my box for my inconvenience. I confirmed my address with her, but then this Ella J. Denied a shipment of a new box at no charge and proceeded to tell me to wait for my ""next shipment"" of wine that I wouldnt get to choose and double the cost of introductory price. I sent screenshots of the previous reps satisfactory resolution to Ella J. She said she would move the date back for next shipment but would not make up for lack of communication from FirstLeaf on my delivery, adhere to previous reps satisfactory agreement with me, and did not give the list of my wine I originally wanted and was still going to charge me for them after all this back and forth and waiting being said and done.  I would not recommend this company's customer service if anything doesn't go perfect.  They will not help you."

The survey did take about 10 minutes, but I found the survey site slightly difficult to navigate. However, all in all, the experience was good.

firstleaf	US	Firstleaf is a great wine club	20 July 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Firstleaf is a great wine club.  We belonged for about 3 years and they only provide the best of wines.  Due to health reasons we have to leave the club as we can no longer enjoy the fine wines.
firstleaf	US	I’ve been in the wine business	17 June 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Having ran a small wine shop in the past I was excited to see what Firstleaf had in store for me. I love a great Cabernet so all of my choices were reds. I received my order quickly but it made me a little nervous the bottles were actually warm when I opened the box. After looking through each bottle and reading the descriptions I soon understood what was happening. Any Cabernet from South Africa or Shiraz from Australia is always the cheapest, nonetheless little known, bottle of wines. All of the wines were weak, none of them notable and none of them would I pay over $5 for. They know exactly what they’re doing.  You’re getting crap that you haven’t seen before and they’re marketing it as high end. Total thumbs down.
firstleaf	US	Firstleaf is amazing	07 June 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Firstleaf is amazing! All the reviews calling it a scam seem to be from people who were too eager to take advantage of their First Time Order promotion and didn’t pay attention to what they were signing up for. I have referred probably 20-25 people to Firstleaf and none have had an issue. This is a wine club! Clubs come with memberships! Whenever you are signing up for something and have to enter your credit card and personal info, make sure you read all the print large and fine. I love this wine company because they are very upfront about how their club works. Yes, you get a great deal on your first order and then you are a member. If you are not ok with being a member you can go to your account and cancel your membership. They do try to keep you by offering deals but there is always the option to continue on to cancel. If you do want to be a member you follow the rules. You don’t just get to pick whatever wine you want unless you want to go to their store and just buy whatever, but that isn’t considered purchases made through the membership. You are given the option to switch wines 6 times per order. Once you click reserve wines, your selections are locked in and you will be charged regardless of when the wine is supposed to be shipped. It’s the same as booking plane tickets. Pay upfront whether you flight out tomorrow or a year from now. You can wait until closer to the time of shipping to reserve your wine but you risk not getting the wines that were originally picked because the algorithm is constantly changing to whatever is in stock. If you do end up on a pickle, their customer service is much better at emailing and have always responded to my inquiries even for when I just didn’t receive all my wine description cards. Also, if you don’t like a wine you receive they will send you a new one or give you credit!
firstleaf	US	Less than one star service	04 June 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I was pleasantly surprised with my first order. I immediately placed a second order and used a wine concierge to help me choose the bottles. I loved the help and loved the second order.I then placed an order through a special offer. It was a great deal. Unfortunately, I received a shipment that was three bottles less than what I had ordered and none of the bottles that I had selected. I called and spoke to a very nice representative. She assured me that this would be taken care of and she was filing a claim. I waited more than a week and received no shipment or communication from Firstleaf. I called and was assisted by a less than helpful person who said that a claim has been filed, and I could either cancel my order or re-order it at that point in time. What? I had expected to receive the order that I had placed originally. Unfortunately, by this time, two of the original nine bottles that I had chosen were not available. And since the representative was not at all helpful, I called back a few days later to try to get someone more helpful to help me sort this out. I was told that half of the order was unavailable. And while the representative that helped me the third time I called was helpful, there was nothing that she could do.In addition, I found that if you choose to reserve an order, you will be charged you at that time whether you choose to have it shipped immediately or months later. I don’t believe this was made clear. I genuinely regret that Firstleaf does not have better service.  I really enjoyed the wines and felt they were a great deal. It was fun to have access to so many wines from all over the world. But, there is simply too much time required to be sure that you are actually getting what you ordered and for what you have already been billed. I am surprised and disappointed at how unfriendly their policies are to their customers.
firstleaf	US	ill from wine	17 March 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Hi, I usually never complain or write emails like this, but I just wanted to let your company know that I had friends over a couple times and we all have gotten extremely Ill from your wine on multiple occasions. We ordered 2 cases as the promo, but after myself, my fiancé and friends started to feel very sick in the stomach and some of us actually vomited from this wine, it is NOT quality and will never be ordering from this site again.
firstleaf	US	WARNING SCAM ALERT!!!!Was not told…	09 March 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	WARNING SCAM ALERT!!!!Was not told upfront that I would be sent wine I didn't order or pick out and my card would be charged without my permission, I bought from them instead of others just for that reason I didn't want to have to buy wine on a monthly bases like most clubs do but this business found a way to do it they don't tell you upfront they bury it in the details with one little sentence at least the other online wine clubs tell you upfront in bold print and more than once what you're getting into and this business instead of taking their wine back and giving my money back or crediting my account said it's on me that I didn't check for the hidden sentence. It's sad that so many online businesses get away with this sort of entrapment rip-off scam I can say I've had a few other businesses do the same thing BUT THEY DID TAKE BACK ORDERS AND REFUND MY MONEY , these people don't care if you ever join their club in the future they just want your money not interested in customer satisfaction knowing they purposely don't explain upfront you will get any wine they choose to send every month and charge you for it, we need to pass better laws to protect us from businesses just like this one. I will be filing a complaint with the BBB if we don't they will continue this sneaky practice.
firstleaf	US	WARNING they don't tell you up front…	09 March 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	WARNING they don't tell you up front like most do that you will be sent wine every month and charged with out your knowledge or even picking out the wine you want it's sad that allot of online business's practice this deception making it hard to trust buying online and you won't be able to send it back they won't give refund and take the wine you didn't pick or ask for which makes it hard to keep customers because I will never buy anything from these scammers ever again..
firstleaf	US	I have absolutely LOVED Firstleaf	03 March 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I have absolutely LOVED Firstleaf!

firstleaf	US	I LOVE First Leaf!	10 January 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I have been a member of First Leaf for about a year and a half and LOVE it!  You are able to make it exactly what you want:  how often you receive an order, how many bottles, and type (red, white or combo.)  The wine club concierges are so friendly and helpful, and their customer service is outstanding.

This is managed to hone my taste and to zero-in on my future shipment with the help of my wine concierge, Lauren.  Once I sorted out the delivery process everything has gone just fine.I look forward to each and every shipment and trust the Club!
firstleaf	FI	Unbelievable experience	26 December 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I love drinking wine, because wine makes me calmer. I'm pretty anxious person and only wine helps me in this situation. I tried so many time to do something else, however everything was for nothing. I have decided to enter wine club because it seemed to me that I'm master in it. I found this company in the internet and everything was okay. I have never been so happy as nowadays because i do my favorite activity and enjoy this life. I guess everybody who is also addicted to wine should pay attention to this club, because it's an unbelievable experience.
firstleaf	US	I love being a Firstleaf member	22 December 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I love being a firstleaf member! We joined at the beginning of the pandemic (March 2020) and truly enjoy trying new wines. They are always great and the staff have been amazing, especially my wine concierge Lauren. Great company and concept and looking forward to many more boxes!
firstleaf	FR	Total Fraud Company	16 December 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I can confirm what others have said; the company operates with the intent of constantly frauding the customer.  The first instance occurred around OCT of 2021 when I delayed my next shipment for a few months but the company claimed the order was already processed and could not be changed or delayed.  Their concession was to put my account on hold until APR 2022.  Low and behold I happen to find yet another charge to my account in DEC 2021.  When I inquired about it the rep responded with yes I see that your account is on hold but we decided to place an order for you in DEC 2021 so you will be fully stocked.  So literally they will do unauthorized charges on your account whenever they feel like it and claim that you didn't respond to an email to tell them to stop.  What the F!  Pure FRAUD!  Good luck on your CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT that I am starting.
firstleaf	US	Love, love, love	02 December 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Love, love, love Firstleaf. With their emphasis on Northern California products, every wine I've ever received has been delicious and distinctive. The wines each come with cards that tell you all about the winery they come from and their flavor profiles. And their website is beautiful, easy to use, and dripping with satisfaction guaranteed. All this for an average $13 a bottle, free shipping and no fees. I highly recommend Firstleaf for anyone interested in a truly great wine club!
firstleaf	US	I've been a Firstleaf club member for…2 - 3 years	25 November 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I've been a Firstleaf club member for 2-3 years and am quite satisfied. They offer very good wine at a fair price. The tasting notes supplied with shipments are nice to have, and my ratings of wine received help determine future shipments.Especially nice is the specialized service I can receive from my a wine concierge like Casey whom I have found helpful. Although I occasionally order wine from another online source due to a cheaper price, I will say that Firstleaf's wines are a cut above those from this other club. So, in summary, I give Firstleaf 5 stars.
firstleaf	US	Lauren is the BEST!!!	24 November 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I joined this club about 2 years ago, and discovered my own wine concierge, Lauren, this year after needing to figure out some delivery challenges (no fault of theirs). I absolutely love every wine she has recommended, she gets my taste exactly and knows how to steer me to something new. I look forward to each and every shipment and love this club!! Some of the best wines I have ever tried have come from here....
firstleaf	US	The only wine club for me	19 November 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I've tried several subscription wine clubs, but Firstleaf is the only one I've stuck with. The wines are excellent, the rating system ensures that the next delivery is better than the last, and the customer service is outstanding. The concierge feature in particular is absolutely stellar.
firstleaf	US	Enthusiastic Customers for Sure!	19 November 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	We started the club a year ago or longer now. Our shipments are every two months and so far it has been a wonderful experience. I get reds only and though I haven't loved all the wine, I love trying so many different varietals, labels, vineyards, and locations! If you absolutely don't like a wine they credit you for it in your next shipment which is amazing. We have not had to do that yet because either we are so so about their selections or we love them!! I have discovered I really enjoy many Shiraz and petite Syrahs which I seldom, if ever had had or bought in the past. I also love that if I find one I really like I can talk to my personal concierge, Casey and they will put it in my next shipment.Oh and yes!! Having a wine concierge is a bonus! They strive to pick our wines based on our ratings and tasting notes we are requested to enter in our account online ratings which is a good system. However, speaking to a real person who is knowledgeable and personable is extremely helpful in picking and choosing wines and varietals. We are enthusiastic,100% happy customers and have invited 2 other friends so far to join and they love being in the club. It is well worth the cost!!

firstleaf	US	Excellent wine club	03 November 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Excellent wine club. The wines are good quality and all of them selected based on my personal preferences (citrusy, oakey, not too sweet, etc.). I dealt with 3 reps and they were some of the best customer service professionals I have spoken to. Because of travel I had to cancel after the trial and canceling was seamless, 1 click, no tricks. Highly recommended.
firstleaf	US	Problems With Availability	26 October 2021	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	"I was in the club for a year and really enjoyed it. It is so nice to come home to a package of surprise wine selections. My husband and I liked 90% of the wines they sent us according to our taste profile. The problem was when we found a wine we liked (which we did several times) and tried to order more from Firstleaf. They never had any stock of the ones we wanted, especially the Firstleaf ""exclusives."" The other problem is that their system would allow me to order an out-of-stock wine, but then Firstleaf would substitute something else and I wouldn't get the one I knew I liked. After this happened multiple times, we quit the club."
firstleaf	US	Unauthorized order	19 October 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I made my first order yesterday. Today I see TWO transactions in my bank statement. Second transaction from Firstleaf is almost $100. I didn’t make the second order. What’s the scam…..
firstleaf	US	The Best	08 October 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	As always, Casey does an excellent job of providing customer service and assuring that I get exactly the wines she thinks I will enjoy. I appreciate her patience in trying to please . I do wish you had more Chardonnay selections, including the less oaked but with full body. Thank you for providing this concierge service.
firstleaf	US	Great by all means!	04 October 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	As many others here, I have enjoyed almost every wine I was sent do far, and do not remember major disappointments.  Wide variety of styles, regions, tastes that are rarely found in mainstream stores, especially at these prices, make this club consistently enjoyable!  I do agree though  that adding some Southeastern Europe varieties would be wonderful additional breath of fresh air.

firstleaf	US	Firstleaf is GREAT because it delivers…	30 September 2021	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	Firstleaf is GREAT because it delivers a broad variety of wines from diverse regions: domestic and international.Many / most of the wines are good to very good.  I drink enough wine that I try to keep my bottle price low, and you'll get some 'clunkers' with that strategy. But, we're pleased overall and enjoy our Firstleaf membership.EDIT:  I'm reminded of Firstleaf's satisfaction guarantee, whereby I can return the odd 'clunker' for credit.  Thanks, Firstleaf!

Feedback is important, so your shipments contain wines that most closely match your taste. It’s always exciting to receive a new box and try the wines. Then you can order a small batch of your favorite. The customer care of this company is also excellent and very responsive. Keep up the good work.
firstleaf	US	Enjoy	20 September 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I love getting the types of wine I enjoy delivered to my home. I get to pick what I like and it is affordable.  There have been only a few that didn’t meet with my palate, I have really enjoyed about 98%.
firstleaf	US	I really wanted to like their wines	19 September 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I really wanted to like their wines.  I opened each bottle with renewed anticipation.  But after 2 glasses, the rest of the bottle goes down the drain.  I have gone thru most of the bottles I have purchased. The wine is just too sour for me.  For what I paid for 2 cases (most poured down the drain), I could have purchase 6-12 bottles of high end / high quality wine that I would have savored and enjoyed.   It was very hard to complain to the company.  No one cared.
firstleaf	US	Love it!	18 September 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I love this service! I haven't had a bad wine yet, & I always feel confident bringing over a selection from First Leaf to a dinner party or get together. Each box also comes with lots of information about the wine, it's production, & suggested pairings. Great for wine newbies or experienced wine lovers.
firstleaf	US	Easy, tasty, and fun!	18 September 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Joined during the first few months of the pandemic. I was stuck in my house and really needed to travel and explore. So if I couldn't take that trip to France or Italy, I figured I would bring a little of Europe to me. Firstleaf continues to be a great source of testing and learning, with great varieties and origins, and I can get as involved as I like in the selections before each box is shipped. Easy, tasty, and fun!
firstleaf	US	Help for this novice	16 September 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Firstleaf has been so helpful for a wine novice such as myself.  Rarely do I receive a wine that I don't like, and now that I am discussing each order with concierge, they are all fabulous.  Keep up the good work.
firstleaf	US	Best Day of the Month is when my Firstleaf Shipment appears!	16 September 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	We've been members for 5 years and love it! Having our personal win concierge is a bonus. We are introduced to many wines we would have never found. We really enjoyed the recent virtual wine tasting. (more on my blog: joeannsview.com about that)
firstleaf	US	Happy Customer	16 September 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I have been a Firstleaf member for ~1 year.  I appreciate both the flexibility to time the shipments (1,2,3 months) and also to dial in your profile (reds, whites, sweet, dry, domestic, worldwide, etc) & then change it as you wish.  Aside from the excellent wines, Firstleaf also allows you to reorder wines you really like at the same discounted price.  The free shipping on a case is another great perk!
firstleaf	AU	Wine and quality top notch	16 September 2021	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	
firstleaf	US	Better than other services I've tried	16 September 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	The wine was far better than similar other services I have used. I was hesistant at first because the bottles are preselected and you can only switch each one out once per order. But the wines that I thought i would dislike actually ended up being my favorites! This isn't just a bunch of $3 bottles of toilet wine, its actually high quality stuff. I'd use the service more,  but i don't drink much and regular shipments just accumulate in my pantry never to be used. If you have guests frequently or have a couple bottles every week though, I'd definitely recommend firstleaf.

firstleaf	US	The wines are very good, Shipping is horrible	15 September 2021	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	The wines are very good.  I love the cards with the information about the wines.  However, Firstleaf cannot get my shipping right.  They never send to the default address and I have to contact FedEx to reroute every time.  I've contacted customer service and it did not help a bit.  It's not worth it any more and I cancelled my membership due to this.
firstleaf	US	Well Done!!	15 September 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Great selection of curated wines that you are unlikely to find elsewhere, reliable shipping, and fantastic customer service…what more could you ask for? Well, maybe free wine, but it is reasonably priced!
firstleaf	US	Newbie with wine	15 September 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	First time joining a wine club and I’m super pleased with Firstleaf. Easy to pick, easy to change shipping dates. The best part is that we literally have enjoyed every wine that’s been sent. I highly recommend them for newbies like myself . I have received 3 orders so far and I plan on continuing my membership.

firstleaf	US	Great wine club!	15 September 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I tried Firstleaf out after receiving a promo code from a relative for a free first box. I've kept the subscription going for several reasons. 1. Great wines! I was tired of always choosing the same wines at the store and wanted to explore new flavors. I love that you get a preview of what's coming and can swap out bottles. 2. Customer service - I can pause shipments if the wine-drinking has been slow with no penalty. For this last box I also had a phone call meeting with someone to further tailor my box to match my likes. 3. Cost - cost per bottle is definitely reasonable and makes me feel this is a sustainable subscription for my budget. All in all, would definitely recommend at least trying Firstleaf out!
firstleaf	US	"All I can say is ""WOW!"""	15 September 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I belong to one wine club which only features California wines - which are excellent. But I wanted to sample wines from around the world - South Africa, Italy, France, etc. Firstleaf has wines from everywhere! And, as a member, I can preview my shipments, change out wines I don't want and read all about each bottle I am receiving! I have sampled wines I never would have tried on my own. The prices of Firstleaf are low enough to encourage experimenting - I have never been disappointed, And with Christmas coming - my firends will benefit from my experience. It is like having my own wine club! I am so happy to have found Firstleaf.

A bit pricey compared to some of the other wine clubs or going to total wine on your own, but Firstleaf is very reliable and convenient.  Besides, life is too short to drink bad wine, and I’ve never received a wine that I disliked.
firstleaf	US	I love First Leaf-App please!	14 September 2021	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	I love First Leaf. I have never had a bad wine from them. I frequently gift bottles to friends, who are also pleased. That being said, I wish it was easier to read about my wine order and make modifications on the go. They need a mobile app.
firstleaf	US	love firstleaf!	14 September 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I am a very satisfied firstleaf customer.  I have been receiving wine through them for quite a few years and feel the quality and diversity of wines firstleaf offers is great.

I've tried numerous wine subscriptions, wine clubs and pick-it-myself trips to the local Specs or Total Wine, and occasionally a Krogers or H-E-B, but i've never been able to consistently select such great wine for such an affordable price. Would highly recommend this service, both for value and convenience.

firstleaf	US	First let me tell you what I like about…	14 September 2021	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	First let me tell you what I like about Firstleaf:1. My wines are shipped on schedule.2. The wines I select, so far have all been really tasty.3. Customer service, in particular my concierge, Lauren, make doing business with Firstleaf easy and stress free.Two things that keep me from giving you the fifth star, however, is that I seem to get the same wines each month. I would like to see a wider selection of European brands. Secondly, When I do a bottle swap why is it like playing a game. I have no control of what I'm swapping for and only get six tries. Why not just show me all the selections available?Thanks for asking.   Jim
firstleaf	US	This is a great wine club	14 September 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	This is a great wine club.  Very versatile and great selections.

firstleaf	US	Best Wine Club	14 September 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I have tried several wine clubs and find Firstleaf to beperfect for me. I can switch choices, delay shipments, go from red to white and mix and substitute if I want to before shipping.  I always enjoy my wines, they have me figured out! Prices are great too.
firstleaf	US	Great selection and convenience	14 September 2021	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	Great selection of moderate priced wines.  You get to enjoy high quality wines delivered to your door.  Many imported wines are not available where I reside so I like  Firstleaf's choice of the wines offered.
firstleaf	US	I have gained wine-confidence through First Leaf!	14 September 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I am so happy I started using Firstleaf. Not only have I been able to try wines from all over the world, I have also discovered what I truly enjoy along the way. I was never incredibly educated on wines, but knew a few I enjoyed. Now I can confidently say which types I prefer and a few of the regions from which I prefer the wines.  I haven't regretted this decison at all.  I highly recommend First Leaf, they are so helpful and match you with your likes very well.
firstleaf	US	So good	14 September 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	So good! So reliable! So sad that a recent accident has caused me to eliminate wine (well, all alcohol, but I do miss my wine!) temporarily. But I like that I can do that, too. Will resume as soon as medications can mix again...to have a variety of reliably tasty and new to me wines in my pantry makes us very happy. Totally recommend without hesitation...
firstleaf	US	Excitement in Wine Exploration	14 September 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I have had nothing but great experiences with Firstleaf!

Additionally, the Firstleaf community is so welcoming!I feel like a vino explorer with the different bottles that are available, both when they are selected for me and when I can roam the site myself. I cannot recommend this service enough whether you're a wine novice or a fellow vino explorer, there is something for everyone!

Both representatives were very helpful and pleasant throughout the extended process due to allergies in our family.   I am looking forward to sharing my selections with family and friends as they visit throughout the year
firstleaf	US	This is not the subscription to cancel.	14 September 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I’ve received two orders so far and out of the 12 bottles, only one was mediocre. The wines are always quality and I’m never shy about opening a new bottle I’ve never had, for company. The only way you could beat the price is by buying $5 screw off chuck at a discount liquor store that you know won’t go down easy. I’m not one for subscription memberships, but this one, I keep.

I think it would be helpful if there was a way in which I. Oils go back and see all wines I have ever ordered
firstleaf	US	slow delivery	14 September 2021	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	The wine is great. My partner said he has never had a bad wine from you guys, some are better than others but never bad. The problem we had this time was delivery. wine was to come on Tuesday but never showed up till the following Monday. they do this every time but never this late. Maybe you should find another carrier.

firstleaf	US	First Leaf came into my life…	13 September 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	First Leaf came into my life (literally) at the beginning of the pandemic. I’m sure like many of you. I have friends that have used other wine services but there really is nothing like First Leaf. I can’t tell you I’ve hated any bottles they’ve sent me, but plainly because I told them the truth. What I like and what I absolutely don’t want, but staying open minded as well. Great company. My orders have always arrived at very reasonable times and never an issue! Thank you!
firstleaf	US	Disappointed in White Wine Selection	13 September 2021	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	The wines are fabulous but what I don’t like is the repeat of white wines in the package I get at my frequency. I want to try new wines but it seems the whites are limited hence the frequency of repeats.

firstleaf	US	Consistently good wines for the price!	13 September 2021	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	We moved to a smaller community with limited options for wines, except big-box wines.  We missed being able to shop for superior values in wines from smaller vineyards. With Firstleaf I have found a way to try wines from smaller vineyards and they are certainly better than what we could find in our local stores for the same price.  I have been in a number of wine clubs in the past and this provides a more consistently quality wine for the price than the other clubs.
firstleaf	US	I have been very happy with First Leaf	13 September 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I have been very happy with First Leaf. The wines have been very good and the special deals are definitely worth grabbing. The communication and shipping has been excellent. I highly recommend.

firstleaf	US	Great Wines	13 September 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I am fairly new to FirstLeaf.  So far I have liked all of the wines I received, some better than others. I like the cards with the descriptions of the wines and I keep my favorites in a separate envelope so that I can re-order them in the future. For now, I am content to try new wines which are shipped to me based on my taste preferences. My FirstLeaf profile is spot on as far as identifying what I like in a wine.

I have been a member now for almost 2 years and it was a awesome choice to become a member of this wine club.  Firstleaf is second to no other wine club out there.
firstleaf	US	Everywhere wines!	13 September 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I have enjoyed this wine club for the last two years, or so.  The most  important reason being, that I get wines from all over!  I love the Argentinian wines, wines from Spain and Italy.  It is interesting to try, not only wines from WA and CA, but from other countries.

firstleaf	US	The best of the bunch!	13 September 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I have tried several wine clubs over the years and Firstleaf is by far the best of the lot. Flexibility on both selection and delivery makes it easy to get what you want when you want it. The wine selections are great, mostly 8, 9's and 10's on my scale, and if a wine is bad (very seldom) then you get a credit.  In other words 100% satisfaction!

I love the variety and can’t wait to see what arrives next. I’m not a wine connoisseur and can’t describe the wines I love in a way a connoisseur would be able to describe them. What I can say is that I’m glad I joined and have had exceptional wines and service. I’ve recommended First Leaf to all my friends.

I've been a member since 2019 and have had just 1 problem that was corrected to my satisfaction. At prices fm $10.33 to $13.33 p/b you can't go wrong. They caught on to my preferences quickly. Reliable club.
firstleaf	US	Customer service is very good	13 September 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Customer service is very good. The wines have been very nice. I don’t have much money to spend on wine, and don’t drink it very often, but they always let me postpone until I’m ready to order again.
firstleaf	US	Glad we signed up during COVID....	13 September 2021	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	We signed up during COVID on the recommendation of our son. It was so nice not to have to shop for wine in the store at that time.  The Firstleaf wine selection is pretty good. There have been a few that we didn't care for but we have tried many more different wines that we would normally.  We have ordered a few additional bottles of some that we enjoyed and have taken advantage of the special deals that are offered. The customer service is excellent and the website very easy and convenient to use.   It was easy to ship a gift box to a friend and to change our delivery date while we were away last month. I also like the ability to swap wines prior to shipment if desired. Love the free shipping on 12 bottles too!
firstleaf	US	My Concierge	13 September 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	My Concierge, Casey Huntington has given me great service.  She responds quickly to my emails and I have a lot of confidence in her.  She is a gem to First Leaf!!!

firstleaf	US	Decent wine, and usually always surprised!!	13 September 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I have been with Firstleaf all year (2021) and I have recommended the club to both friends and family.  My brother actually signed up as well.  We are both pleasantly surprised.   There are a few wines that I'm not a huge fan of, but for the number of bottles we have had delivered, the majority are all pretty decent $10-15 of wine.    Customer service is also excellent, when you call, you are talking to a real person, who actually has some wine knowledge.   I had one lost delivery and Firstleaf replaced fairly quickly.
firstleaf	US	Wonderful surprises every delivery	13 September 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	This club truly gives me a chance to try wines I would probably would not have bought on my own. Every one has been at least worth the price. Some are much better than others. They arrive as promised. I have had issues with FedEx not ringing my unit (I live in a condo building with a locked lobby), but that is not Firstleaf's problem.I especially like the inclusion of dry rosés. They can be hard to find in supermarkets.

firstleaf	US	Positive Experience All Around	13 September 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Positive Experience All Around! My partner and I were looking for a wine club that would be tailored to our tastes, not break the bank, providing both domestic and international wines, and could be changed according to our needs. Firstleaf delivered on all counts and we love that we can order more of our favorites, too! We have absolutely enjoyed being able to try new wines, expand our knowledge and palates, and experiment together. We chose to get 12 bottles (2 of each variety curated for each delivery) and have really appreciated being able to experiment with the same wine on different occasions.
firstleaf	US	Best wine club	13 September 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Best wine club! I tried other 3x so far, and Firstleaf is the best! Great quality wines, specially the Europeans and Latin Americans. Easy to manage and the attendants are very gentle and efficient.
firstleaf	US	I’ve enjoyed all the wines we’ve…	13 September 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I’ve enjoyed all the wines we’ve received aside from a couple. My only complaint is that I really enjoyed a wine that can no longer be purchased but I suppose that’s the nature of wine.
firstleaf	US	I haven't tasted a wine I like yet	13 September 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I haven't tasted a wine I like yet. That's too bad because I like wine. I have better luck going to the liquor store.
firstleaf	US	My selections	13 September 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Thus far, I am pleased with the selections of wine. I have not gotten around to tasting all yet, but I’m very impressed. My wine selection is growing and to select what I have and share with family and friends is awarding. Thank you so much.
firstleaf	US	A sommelier for everyone	13 September 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Even if you don’t already know what type of wines you like, this service helps you get wines that you will be pleased with at a great price.
firstleaf	US	We love your wine!	13 September 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	We feel that the selections of wine you send us is so much better than any wine that we pick from a store, even when they help us with the selection.  We love your wine!
firstleaf	US	All the wines I received were good	13 September 2021	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	All the wines I received were good.  However, I think because First Leaf was so enthusiastically recommended, I expected them to all be outstanding, so I was disappointed.  That being said, the Longitude 120 West Cab I had last night was superb.
firstleaf	US	Great Wine Club!	13 September 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Great Wine Club!I like this wine club more then any I have tried and over the years I have tried several wine clubs. I like this club because it has wines that I enjoy and a nice variety. I am not a fan of white wine and with the help of their advisor I tried some and they were excellent! I also like the description cards that are included with your wine. The customer service is excellent and goes above and beyond that of other wine clubs. I definitely recommend the Firstleaf Wine Club!
firstleaf	US	I myself do not drink wine!	13 September 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I myself do not drink wine but the site is easy and friendly! I can consult with my love and pick and choose the wines she likes and try a few new ones ! Had to buy a wine fridge so they would always be ready for drinking ! No more oh I forgot I need wine ! Lol love that !
firstleaf	US	Excellence in Customer Experience	13 September 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Been part of the club for over 2 odd years. I do love the convenience and the guidance in ordering the wines, the selections are good and the customer service team offers excellence choices to swap/satisfy the selection criteria.
firstleaf	US	Wine is good quality but deliver…	13 September 2021	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	Wine is good quality but deliver requiring signature is always painful.  The wine never arrives when projected to arrive.  I will probably return to COSTCO for future wine purchases.
firstleaf	US	Customer service has been very helpful	13 September 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Customer service has been very helpful.  Wines have been very good.  There have been some that I have not been particularly thrilled.  However, they were still good.  Love the wine cards that come with each order.

firstleaf	US	I received my 1st shipment weeks ago	13 September 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I received my 1st shipment weeks ago, took me a while to get around to tasting my selections.  I have to say that there was not a single bottle that I didn't like.  Waiting for my next shipment which I scheduled for later this month.  Love the user friendly website, the ease of ordering and the ability to choose your shipping dates.
firstleaf	US	2 years, not one bad wine!	13 September 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	"We have had Firstleaf for almost 2 years, and have never had a bad wine. Only 1 was ""okay"", the rest have been good or excellent.  The customer service has been very helpful,  and the ratings are super easy to add after tasting."
firstleaf	US	Generally good wines for reasonable price	13 September 2021	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	Generally good wines for reasonable price. I wish it were easier to change selections for regular shipments.
firstleaf	US	Another great review!	13 September 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I have read many of the reviews and agree heartily with those that have praise for the club. The majority of the wines shipped (I only get reds) are really good - a few are excellent - some are just okay. However, the 'okays' are far and few between and frankly, for the price, I think it is unbeatable. Oh, and their customer service, is equally terrific.
firstleaf	US	I have never had an issue until my last…	13 September 2021	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	I have never had an issue until my last order this week. I have always specified reds wines, the email sent to me showed reds to be coming. When I opened box and started putting away they were all whites.
firstleaf	US	First rate wine club	13 September 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Excellent choice of wines at good prices, quick and efficient customer service. Varied range of good reds, our usual favorite. But some very nice whites which we don’t usually like too much. And not drunk rose wine in 40+ yrs, but recent batch on special was just so good, we’ll be buying more.
firstleaf	US	Always quality wine	13 September 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Always quality wine.  Monthly subscription and bundles.  And selections from wine store.  Rarely, rarely disappointing.  Terrific value.  And the customer service is outstanding.

firstleaf	US	Thrilled!	13 September 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	In a word, I am thrilled with the Firstleaf experience! The wine concierges have totally discerned my taste in wines. I did not think it possible, but the wines I receive get better and better with each shipment. The wines are packaged beautifully; shipments are always on time; the wine descriptions included are accurate and helpful; and I love the special deals offered. I couldn't be happier with the value, product, customer  service, and the company's environmental stamp.
firstleaf	US	Always looking forward to our next shipment.	13 September 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Service is as advertised.  Easy to work with and a nice variety of wines delivered.  We always look forward to each shipment.

Their customer service is outstanding, very responsive and quick to reply with answers to my questions. The wines they have chosen for me have been outstanding. My husband and I have enjoyed every single bottle so far. I love how we are able to control how many bottles and how often they are shipped. So glad we joined Firstleaf!
firstleaf	US	Have Personal Wine Concierge!!	13 September 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Great club! High quality wines at great prices plus expert help to understand and select.

The only issue is we never seem to have any wine left before the next delivery arrives!!??Keep them coming!!
firstleaf	US	Great service, fantastic wines	13 September 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Love FirstLeaf. The wines are unique and allow us to try new ones that we would have never would come across otherwise. Customer service is top-notch, and everything is made very easy to pick, order, and purchase.
firstleaf	US	I love Firstleaf	13 September 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I love Firstleaf. I get to switch out some bottles based on sweetness, acidity, etc. descriptions and it continues to learn my tastes based on my past reviews of wines, and I've yet to get a bottle I haven't enjoyed. I really love how affordable it is, and how I can schedule deliveries instead of being forced to get a shipment every single month. I've belonged to quite a few wine clubs in the past and this is by far my favorite.
firstleaf	US	Well worth it!	13 September 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Granted, not all the wines are winners, but allowing for the subjective factors, we feel that Firstleaf has consistently delivered very good wines at a very good price. We have reordered many of them. And Ashley ( spelling?) in customer service is second to none. We’ve recommended Firstleaf to many friends and will continue to do so.
firstleaf	US	Great wine club!	13 September 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	The wines are very good and so interesting from different areas of the world.

firstleaf	US	Great wine great service	13 September 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I am pleased to write this review. I've traveled the world seeking small Vineyard wines since 1974.

firstleaf	US	It’s a great club to join	13 September 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	It’s a great club to join - let’s us try different wines that we would not have thought to try, with Firstleaf taking into account our likes from previous wines.
firstleaf	US	Love the Surprises!	13 September 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I (try to) always give feedback on my last shipment, and Firstleaf sends me fabulous wines each time. I never look at what is coming in the next box. Such fun to get a surprise ... like a gift from someone who knows you well. Love it!!
firstleaf	US	I have been a member for several months…	13 September 2021	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	I have been a member for several months and have gotten the same wines shipped to me multiple times. I have ordered my favorite wine separately and have never gotten it in my monthly shipments. Yesterday I received two wines I have already gotten. Thinking about canceling.
firstleaf	US	Good Wine / Great Customer Service	13 September 2021	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	I have subscribed to Firstleaf for about 3 years now and have not been disappointed once.  In fact, not only do I get monthly deliveries I get additional shipments from time to time as well.  The selection of wine is good and the prices are competitive.
firstleaf	US	Great all around	13 September 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	So far I have enjoyed all the wines, the selection is a higher quality than the other wine subscriptions that I have tried, great packaging, great options to push shipments out according to need, and great customer service. No complaints after 2 years of use

firstleaf	US	Love this company!	13 September 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I have been so please with 99% of the wines I have received in my boxes. I went from getting a box every 3-4 months to sometimes multiple boxes monthly because we have enjoyed so many…not to mention they are a great price!

I would say of all the wines we have tried only one that I didnt particularly like but my husband loved.  We agree on most wines and its always fun to get a new package in the mail! Just like Christmas!
firstleaf	US	I appreciate Firstleaf	13 September 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I appreciate Firstleaf.  The wines are a nice variety and the prices are great.  It's wonderful to have someone else select new wines for me to try in the taste range I enjoy.  Saves me lots of time at the store making decisions that may not even be true to my taste.
firstleaf	US	I joined Firstleaf in April 2020	13 September 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	"I joined Firstleaf in April 2020, thinking I would ""give it a try"" and cancel if I didn't really feel it lived up to its promise of having award-winning wines that I would enjoy.  Well, here it is September 2021 and I am still a member!  I have been impressed with the international wines, partially because our daughter lives in Australia and we have enjoyed those wines when visiting her.  So, receiving wines from AU or NZ are always a pleasant surprise, perhaps colored by the positive association we have with those countries.  In addition,  we have ordered extra shipments of wines that were exceptional.  We were surprised at how much we liked the roses (my computer will not enter the accent mark, so you know I mean ""rose-A"" and not flowers!) -- not typically something we would go for, so we were pleasantly surprised to find the Firstleaf offerings.I do feel I need to make a comment about Firstleaf's Customer Service:  Because I had ordered extra cases, I was totally thrown when I received notice that another case was going to be shipped this week.  Turns out, I had neglected to note when my REGULAR shipment would be coming.  I quickly contacted Customer Service and Chris helped me.  Not only did he fix that situation but he also noted when the next shipment would arrive.  Then I commented that there is one particular varietal we do not care for, so he corrected my profile so we would not be offered more of that.  I noted that some people gave poor reviews due to shipping.  I have not had that problem :)  In fact, I have found that the shipments arrive exactly when they say they will.  So, I plan on continuing with my membership -- I cannot imagine what would make me cancel it at this point!  Firstleaf has not disappointed, and I find their prices to be more than competitive with what I can purchase locally...."
firstleaf	US	We’ve enjoyed 95% of the wines shipped…	13 September 2021	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	We’ve enjoyed 95% of the wines shipped so far based on the profile I filled out. The initial profile plus being able to rate them once you’ve had them seems to work well in further defining what we like.

We can always count on First Leaf to deliver quality wine at a very reasonable price.  Very grateful we joined the First Leaf family!
firstleaf	US	Firstleaf is the Bomb	13 September 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	The whole experience with Firstleaf has been without a hitch.  The communication is good as well as the prices.  Shipment is always on time.  It's hard to rate the wines because I haven't had a bad one yet.
firstleaf	US	Love Firstleaf	13 September 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I really like this wine membership. I get wines I never would have picked for myself but I end up loving. I don't have any problems with shipping and have yet to received a broken bottle. The packaging keeps all my wine safe until it's time to open.
firstleaf	US	Fantastic experience	13 September 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Fantastic experience!  Great wines at a good price and the customer service has been superb.
firstleaf	US	If You're new to Wine, START HERE	13 September 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	If you don't know much about wine and wouldn't know what to buy if you walked into a wine store, this is a great way to start. By giving your taste preferences, your orders can be crafted to suit your palette. In doing so, you can expand your taste and knowledge by sampling some of the best wines First Leaf can offer. Sure, it's not cheap, but you can spend a fortune at a wine store and come nowhere near the satisfaction level you will get with First Leaf's service and suggestions. If you're still new to wine, I totally recommend this service.
firstleaf	US	Great Wine Club!	13 September 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	We have been members of Firstleaf for 3 or 4 years.  The selection of wines we have tried through Firstleaf is wonderful.  We always look forward to the next shipment.  When we find a wine that we really love, we order several bottles at the great wine club prices.  We have recommended Firstleaf to a lot of people.
firstleaf	US	Our order was not delivered	13 September 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Our order was not delivered, so I contacted Firstleaf and spoke with Chloie.  She found out that the shipment was damaged.  The wines we selected were also unavailable, so she made some suggestions as to which wines would be good for us as a replacement.  Thank you so much !!!

firstleaf	US	Star product…	13 September 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	These are definitely first quality wines. I usually buy cheaper wines and I can tell a big difference.
firstleaf	US	I really enjoy the variety of wines, but...	13 September 2021	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	I really enjoy the variety of wines, and the quality of most of them. I've gotten a few, mostly whites, that were undrinkable, and usually from unstated or vaguely stated sources. But nobody gets it 100% right and it's a delight to get all the different wines. The most irritating failure is delivery. Fedex almost never delivers at the promised date, and my latest order is now five days late. I am most bothered by getting wine that sat for days in a delivery truck or warehouse lacking temperature control. Please switch to another delivery service. UPS has always delivered as promised.
firstleaf	US	Excellent service and wines!	13 September 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Service has been great and delivery prompt. They have matched our tastes in wines beautifully and we have already discovered so many new wines that we enjoy. We couldn’t be happier with the experience!
firstleaf	US	Firstleaf - My First Wine Club	13 September 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Firstleaf is the first wine club I have ever used. I looked at many, but after reading reviews and seeing the options they offer there customers I knew this was the one for me. And believe me when I say I have not been disappointed. Ordering is so easy and it’s great how you can substitute a different wine for one being offered. Delivery is quick and convenient. But the best part is the wine itself. Every one I have tried has been wonderful!  I’ve had the opportunity to try wines from various regions that I never would have selected. It has broadened my taste and made me open and eager to try more.If

firstleaf	US	Best Wine Club I've Found So Far!	13 September 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Very pleased with this wine club. The wines are consistently good with many that are remarkably good. The wines are packaged very well for shipment and come with an informative card about each wine. I like that I can easily change my wine preferences, quantities, and frequency on the website. Very reasonable pricing for the quality of the wine.
firstleaf	US	Very good wines , delivery not so good	13 September 2021	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	"Very good wines at a fair price. Don't care for Fedex's ""delivery by end of day"" policy. Hanging around a full day for a shipment that or may not come gets old."
firstleaf	US	I have received two monthly shipments…	13 September 2021	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	I have received two monthly shipments so far.  The selection of reds, whites is wonderfully varied and almost all have been to our liking.  So much so that I have reordered bottles of our favorites from your wine store.  The response is quick and the prices are very good.  I am very impressed with this wine club and look forward to future offerings.
firstleaf	US	Member since March 2018	13 September 2021	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	My husband purchased a membership for me/us in March 2018. For the most part, since then, our experience was 4 starred. Enter Covid and, unfortunately, I do think that quality of the wines went down (I realize the explanation was based on availabiity, etc) For now, we have reduced our frequency to once every three months or so. Thank you.
firstleaf	US	A great way to taste wine!	13 September 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	We've been members for several years.  Service and wines are almost always great.  We enjoy the variety of international reds and have often ordered cases of wines we really like. Customer service is good and any issues are quickly resolved.  We've recommended Firstleaf to some friends and they like it, too!

firstleaf	US	Oooh Boy! Kid In A Candy Store	13 September 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Oooh Boy!! Do I ever look forward to my bimonthly shipments of wines selected according to my preferences! I already had a pretty good grasp of those offered by my local grocery store with a wide selection from  California, Texas, South America and some French and Italian. But NOW I get to experiment in the same price range per bottle, delivered to my door, and given histories and descriptions of wineries and ratings of the wines that I can try or purchase more of my favorites. I feel like a kid in a candy shop! So fun!! I am a very moderate drinker and only occasionally have someone to share them with but they have been as delighted as I am with the taste and quality. I love being able to rate the wines I love and those I was less excited about to zero in on my preferences even more. I love being exposed to so many wineries I would never know.
firstleaf	US	18-months and 100’s of bottle in, I’d do it again	13 September 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I have been a Firstleaf member for 1.5 years. In the time period, there has been only one wine that I did not really enjoy. The customer service is great and it’s obvious they care about the customer experience. They even give referral bonuses so if you need one, let me know! Don’t miss this great opportunity to get great wines delivered for $13 a bottle!
firstleaf	US	Our favorite wine club…	13 September 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	We have been in three other wine clubs and this is by far our favorite. The variety of wine and ability of First Leaf to hone in on our tastes with their selections has been the best. They make it easy to rate our wines and remember our favorites. We feel the price and value of this club is exceptional.
firstleaf	US	What's Not to Like?	13 September 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Firstleaf has it all.  A wide selection of club wines, most of them good to outstanding. Pricing is very fair - sometimes unbelievably low.  Shipping is prompt and fast.  Customer service is excellent.  It is fun to let Firstleaf select wines for me periodically so I can familiarize myself with different grapes and wineries and expand my knowledge for future orders.  Their website design and information are very helpful.  I love Firstleaf!
firstleaf	US	Big Fans	13 September 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Easy. Fun. Cost effective. We've been Firstleaf members for almost 4 years now, and we still love it. Making changes is super easy, and Firstleaf's customer service is super great to work with.
firstleaf	US	Firstleaf is my favorite wine club!	13 September 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I’ve tried several wine clubs and Firstleaf is my favorite. They do a really great job of paying attention to my reviews and select wines that match my taste. The wine selections are of wonderful quality. There are a number of real gems in each box. I always choose to get 12 bottles because they offer free shipping, which is a nice savings. I once received a red wine I didn’t at all like, and they took the price of those two bottles off of my next shipment. I feel they stand behind their promise of satisfaction. Overall, I’m a very satisfied customer.

firstleaf	US	Decent wine from this group	13 September 2021	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	Decent wine from this group.  I will admit that I do have my fave wineries in Cali (Most Sanoma-had my honeymoon there) but for a group that we don't have much choice in what is in the shipment, you are pretty good!  MUCH better that Luftwaits!!!
firstleaf	US	I have enjoyed the wine I received	13 September 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I have enjoyed the wine I received, good variety and quality. Obviously some I liked better than others but it’s fun tasting the variety I get and I always have a wine on hand to give as a gift.
firstleaf	US	I am very pleased with First Leaf	13 September 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I am very pleased with First Leaf.  In my 1.5 years with them I have only had a couple of bad bottles of wine.  Most have been excellent.  Their pricing is reasonable.  I would recommend this company.
firstleaf	US	Two thumbs up!	13 September 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I've been very happy with Firstleaf so far and have found it far superior to my former wine club. The wines have been uniformly excellent, and the prices are more than fair. I also appreciate how easy it is to schedule deliveries and tailor our orders to suit our particular preferences.
firstleaf	US	Best wine club	13 September 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I buy all my reds through Firstleaf. After a few deliveries and you rate your wines, it is rare that I receive a wine I don’t like. Their experts customize your wines to your taste. My wife also enjoyed the summer collection of whites and rose’. Keep up the good work team and thank you. Great prices too.

firstleaf	US	The wine is great, but the delivery is terrible!	13 September 2021	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	The wine is great, but the delivery is terrible.  I ordered wine a week ago and it still hasn't been delivered.  I have stayed home three days waiting because FedEx said it would be delivered by end of day. Not sure where it is now but it has been in the back of a hot truck for a whole week. The latest update says today, but I'm not optimistic.  Another day that I have to stay home. This is the fourth day my wine will supposedly arrive. Maybe!
firstleaf	US	We've been a member for several years..all good	13 September 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	We've been a member for several years.  In those years I think that none of the offerings were anything but great.  The club has allowed us to try wines that we'd probably overlook in a wine shop.  We have delivered two bottles of each wine, so that when we find one that really pleases us we have another to look forward to.  The delivery is prompt and flawless.  We heartily recommend Firstleaf.
firstleaf	US	Great experience!	13 September 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Firstleaf has been very enjoyable! There is no pressure to purchase and you can adjust delivery times as wanted. The special bundles have been fun as well and I’ve ordered several that way. I’ve had no complaints on the quality of the wine. There was 1 bottle that went bad and Firstleaf immediately refunded me. Great customer service!
firstleaf	US	More options	13 September 2021	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	Wish there were more options. We tend to drink more white than red wine. I’d prefer to be able to choose the amount of red or white. Not necessarily 3 /3. I’m more of a 4 white / 2 red guy. I’d also like to be able to have more choices in wine. We prefer dry white, but not Chardonnay. There are times when 2 or 3 of out whites are Chards.
firstleaf	US	Firstleaf fan	13 September 2021	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	Pros - all wines have been excellent, shipments come on time, diversity of wines has been to our tastes, and the price point is reasonable for our family.Cons - would love to see a more robust rating system and an ability to indicate the degree to which I like a wine. Currently, the rating system is like Netflix - like or dislike. There are some wines that I like, but not as much as the other ones in the package. Would like to be able to tease that out. I think it would help with the diversity of what we receive.
firstleaf	US	Awesome wine	13 September 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Awesome wine! and the price is amazing! love the descriptions that come with the wine as well!

firstleaf	US	Love Firstleaf and would recommend to…	13 September 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Love Firstleaf and would recommend to anyone. They understand my likes and dislikes and always send selections I like. I appreciate trying wines from vineyards I may or may not ever know about. Service is excellent as well. Before shipping, you can review what they have selected and swap out if you want, but I can say I have never had a bottle picked by Firstleaf that I did not like. Great service, great value.
firstleaf	US	Love the wines and the customer service…	13 September 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Love the wines and the customer service is amazing! I had issues with my current shipment they were promptly taken care of by a helpful and friendly customer service rep. It is great to be able to speak to a real person when you need help.

firstleaf	US	Great wine club and customer service!	13 September 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I am shocked at all the negative reviews, as I have had nothing but positive experiences with Firstleaf. Have been a member for 2 1/2 yrs, and since I live alone, I only get deliveries every 4-5 months. That was affected also by COVID, and the fact that I entertain less often. Firstleaf allows me to adjust deliveries to my needs, and they are always VERY clear in their communications. I think people have issues because they do not follow directions, or are not attentive to emails. Customer service has been awesome for me, and there has never been a problem with delivery. I think there was one time I did not like a wine, and was given credit. The variety selected is great, though I am not always quick to rate my wines (my bad) - I would (and do!) recommend Firstleaf to friends and relatives. I enjoy it immensely!
firstleaf	US	It is very difficult to get the type of…	13 September 2021	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	It is very difficult to get the type of wines that I want when it says to review and reserve.  Many times I want to swap out but because I can't get the type of wine that I want I wind up running out of swaps and getting what I don't want.  What is the purpose of rating your wines if every new box has wines you don't want?
firstleaf	US	This is my first wine delivery service	13 September 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	This is my first wine delivery service. Have gotten two shipments so far. Enjoyed the types sent except one and I review that one as a thumbs down. Shipments come a day or so later than expected but that is no problem so far. Since I do not drink much wine I called and changed shipments to every 3rd month.
firstleaf	US	Love Firstleaf	13 September 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I have been a member since January of 2017, and with anything there is always hiccups. Firstleaf wines have been excellent and  when I have had an issue, customer service has been first rate.
firstleaf	US	I look forward to each order	13 September 2021	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	I have enjoyed each order and appreciate the selections. At first I was hesitant to have a subscription, as I am not knowledgeable about wines, but I have not been disappointed. I would recommend Firstleaf for a novice or connoisseur.

I have been using first leaf for about 8 months. I have only received a few wines I did not enjoy. I like being able to skip a month, and or opt to purchase their wines on sale instead.
firstleaf	US	I really like this service	13 September 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I really like this service, they deliver a wide variety of interesting wines.  Over the past year I have noticed that their algorithms, as well as the general layout and function of the website, continues to improve.
firstleaf	US	Firstleaf is first rate!	13 September 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Since being a member of Firstleaf Wine Club, I have learned to enjoy many more varietals of wines. I don’t love every bottle, but I do appreciate the opportunity to give them a try. And customer service as well as the ease of ordering keeps me buying more! Two thumbs up for Firstleaf!
firstleaf	US	Perfect club for us!	13 September 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I personally have never had any problems with my membership. I have read the negative reviews and have never experienced any problems with shipping, other than during hurricanes or ice storm of 2020, no broken bottles (some damaged boxes but none broken) and I have only received 1 or 2 bottles that I have not like. This is to be expected as not every bottle of wine meets expectations. Overall my experience has been excellent and my wife and I eagerly await our shipments! Thank you Firstleaf!
firstleaf	US	We've been members since 2018…	13 September 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	We've been members since 2018 and have been very satisfied with the club. Our ratings have refined our shipments so that we can count on enjoying what is sent every month. Much happier with this arrangement rather than the crap shoot of going to the grocery store and guessing what to buy.
firstleaf	US	Take advantage of the wine concierge!	13 September 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	After being dissatisfied with the shipmentsand being unable to tweak my profile, I requested help from the concierge.  Amanda has phoned me several times to customize my shipment.  She has been wonderful, giving me good insight into the offerings.  Without Amanda's help, my shipments were rather repetitive.

No problem. The upgrade results in no shipping charge.  This policy is fantastic. I'm  even considering order much less from another club as a result I referred my son in law and he too is highly pleased THANKS

The only downside is it can be somewhat difficult to rate wines that you have had in the past. A cleaner interface there would be helpful. Wine has been a great selection and helped to make me try new options.
firstleaf	US	We've been Firstleaf customers for…	13 September 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	We've been Firstleaf customers for about a year and a half.  I've enjoyed the process and we've gotten to the point now where we order wines pretty much on our own.  I have one suggestion: the price of the Firstleaf wine club wines is very reasonable.  But, there are some wonderful wines that are not part of the club (the Phillippe Jacques Bordeaux, for example)  and are priced  3 times as much as a club wine.  I appreciate the quality of the more expensive wines and would like to see wine offerings of this quality that were maybe 2, not 3 times the price of  the club wines.  Surely there is an opportunity to upgrade the experience without tripling the price?
firstleaf	US	Excellent service	13 September 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Excellent service. Very educational and great wines.
firstleaf	US	I am very impressed	13 September 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I am very impressed. We selected a three mont delivery system where we receive four reds and two whites. We have yet to receive a wine we have not truly enjoyed and truth be known purchased in between shipments when we wanted more wines. We have been with Firstleaf for more than three years.
firstleaf	US	Quality of wine.	13 September 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Pleased with the quality and cost of the wine. Since my preference is red satisfied with the  selections available.
firstleaf	US	I can't deal with FedEx anymore	13 September 2021	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	"I have enjoyed learning about different wines and of the four or five wine clubs I have been a part of, I like Firstleaf the best. However, the FedEx shipping is lousy. I get electronic mail that the delivery will be ""sometime tomorrow"" so I put things off so I can be there to sign. I am still waiting today (Monday) for my Saturday delivery. This is the third and last time this will happen because I am cancelling this service."
firstleaf	US	Good experience, will continue membership	13 September 2021	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	Pros: scheduling is easy, shipping is fast, more convenient than shipping for wine in store, many quality wines and some amazing ones, they guarantee all of their wines, I do like the cards that describe the wines, eco friendly packaging Cons: I don’t like some of the wine type and really prefer cabs, but when I keep swapping the wines I can’t get the type of grape I want. I don’t know if the rating of the wines does anything.
firstleaf	US	I’ve been very happy so far	13 September 2021	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	I’ve been very happy so far, with the wines I have received. It’s nice trying different bottles, and if one really stands out, you can purchase separately .

firstleaf	US	4/5 Starts-- Wine 5/5, Website 3/5	13 September 2021	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	We've been part of the wine club for almost a year and the wine has YET to disappoint! We love the varieties, the cards with all of the information about the wine, and even the seasonal bundles. This would absolutely be a great start for anyone curious about wine or just in general wants to try something different. The only reason they don't get a 5/5 stars is the website and user experience leaves something to be desired. Rating the wine makes sense but the website can get a little confusing and it's hard to say what your wine ratings does. It'd be nice to get a recap or update on what preferences appear to be based on ratings.
firstleaf	US	I would say my experience so far has been mediocre.	13 September 2021	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	I would say my experience so far has been mediocre. Some of the wines have been quite good, but the alogorithm still chooses some overly sweet wines, not our taste at all. Adding to the difficulty has been the shipping experience with FEDEX. A case we ordered arrived in the Barrington NJ Fedex location on Thursday and was was loaded on a truck for delivery. The expectation was Thursday. Then we got a notice it was delayed to Friday. And this is Monday, with an outside temperature of 90 degrees, and still it hasn't arrived. They wine will surely be cooked by the time it get here. There has to be a better option for delivery. If I switch to my closest alternative pickup site, I have to drive by two excellent wine shops to pick up my Firstleaf case. The advantage of home delivery goes out the window.  I am hanging in there for now, but not satisfied enough to recommend the service.

Firstleaf has introduced us to wines we would never have tried, and gotten us out of our “wine rut”. While we haven’t liked them all, the concierge service has greatly improved our selections and we have gotten some really delicious wines.

I like Rose' wines, and Firstleaf always finds some nice wines to accommodate my desire for Rose'.  The only negative I have is the shipping.  My last order, just received, was in transit for 9 days.  That's far too long for wine to be subjected to summer temperatures.

firstleaf	US	Fun but needs improvement	02 September 2021	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	"I have been a member for about 1.5 years. It is very fun to receive a monthly shipment, but the algorithm doesnt work very well. My shipment frequently contains wines i have rated negatively or wines i received the month before. It doesnt seem to add Roses. It doesnt choose a good mix of varietals in each shipment.  The concierge service has made me stay. The idea is great, but i think the plan was that we'd buy more of what we have liked from the monthly selection.....but those seem to be out of stock.  Would love free shiping on 6 bottles, then I'd have more space for wines I select.    Rating system is poor. It is so hard to find my own rating for a particular wine, for example I see a wine in my shipment i know i've had before and want to know how i rated it, or ""which rose did i like best"".  1-5 rating might be more useful. And a pop-up of my rating every time a wine I have rated is on my screen, and a sort by rating."

This has nothing to do with their qualities of wine, I just don’t know my palette yet!Be not dismayed! 😂. Two of wines sent were AMAZING!!! Oh and again, I can’t say enough about their customer care team.  I think I’ve contacted them 5 times and they’ve always been very helpful to me, with my NewB questions!One month experience A+. Oh and I don’t know if this is appropriate, but there’s a great Firstleaf Wine Lovers Club group on Facebook.  It completes the whole Firstleaf experience!Yes I’m gushing, I’m having a great time!
firstleaf	US	My first wine club experience.	01 September 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	My experience with First Leaf has been great! As my first wine club the customer service has been amazing, most companies should take a page from First Leaf’s customer service model! I’ve personally never had any shipping issues. The Wine Concierge services has been a great benefit and I have rarely not enjoyed a bottle I’ve received. It’s helped me expand my pallet and appreciation of wine. Thanks First Leaf for a great experience. I realize this is a luxury for me and I appreciate being able to enjoy it.
firstleaf	US	I don't know what all the complaints…	01 September 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I don't know what all the complaints are about below, but I love this club. Great wines, lots of choices. I took the quiz a few months back and have had some great wines delivered ever since. Just figured out that I can order my favorites in the store and not just wait for the monthly shipment! So far, so good. Prices are incredibly reasonable for the quality and the diversity of the wines from across the world is just awesome. I can't get a lot of these wines in my local store, and that's one of the reasons I joined to try new things and have it come right to my door with a reasonable price. Love that the wines are selected just for me adn the cards in the box are beautiful and packed with good information. I've been in other wine clubs and the shipping cost was outrageous and I didn't really feel liked I tried anything new. I'm really happy with Firstleaf and highly recommend it.

firstleaf	US	"Stay Away from ""Wine Clubs"" the worst of the worst go there!"	22 July 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	"This is a hard one because I don't want to hurt the growers and all of those people who have small businesses making wine..but it is a review and other people should know what they are getting. First, I don't know why they even give that quiz..its a terrible way to find out what customers like or dislike.  I thought I made it very clear I didn't like anything acidic, and I liked sweet yet almost every single one of my wines were sour as heck and not in a good way like in Lemonade (since they themselves used that as an example) but like drinking vinegar..I cringe just thinking about it. I don't know where they get their 5 star reviews on their website and personally I don't believe a single one of them..apparently I tried this wine club years ago..and you don't see my review on the website nor will you see the one I just wrote for them either!  There were only 2 bottles of 12 that I could even tolerate and the rest I tried to give away by offering a small glass since they'd been opened and not one person would take a free bottle of wine after tasting them.  One friend I convinced, and she told me a week later that she gave it to another friend because she just couldn't stand the taste of it!!  These were free bottles of wine and several friends and NO ONE WANTED THEM!!  That basically says it all!  I don't know what to tell people to help you make a decision but if you google ""wine clubs"" you'll find pretty bad reviews on almost every single on of them..I got laughed at for even trying one and I won't ever do it again!  Even with the ""special"" price of $40 for 6 bottles..WHAT GOOD IS IT WHEN YOU CAN ONLY STAND TO DRINK ONE OF THEM???!  It's a VERY expensive crappy bottle of wine! ( and I only had 2 glasses of that one bottle and dumped a third of each glass down the sink!)  Then they hit you with an $80 to $90 price tag preferably on a monthly scale and God help you if you want to exchange a bottle,  you get a choice of the same crappy cheap wines OR a jump in price tag for something that you ""hope"" is going to taste better..still have 7 bottles of wine opened on my counter because I don't have room in my fridge (normally you would drink the whole bottle before opening another..CAN'T drink even one single bottle..have 4 more that I can't bare to open..seems like a ""wine club to me"" LOL!"
firstleaf	US	Tried to signup for Firstleaf.club…	22 April 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	"I tried to signup for Firstleaf.club after receiving their $29.95 offer for an initial order of 6 bottles of ""award winning wine"" plus free shipping. Long story short, I followed their signup directions, took their quiz, then tailored their 6 recommended bottles a bit to get 6 bottles that I thought I wouldn't hate, at least. By the time I got to the checkout page the price had jumped from $29.95 to $39.95. I refused to buy based on this clear bait-and-switch tactic. I emailed their customer service department at firstleaf.club (see website for email address). Four days later still no response. Not a good sign when no one one answers the customer service email account. After that I found these reviews. Now I'm glad they didn't answer as that likely saved me from getting ripped off royally!

firstleaf	US	BUYER BEWARE	26 February 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	BUYER BEWARE - FRAUDULENT COMPANY - they will ship you wines without your permission, send you broken bottles they wont replace and they will keep your money and not send your wines!  I ordered for the first time from Firstleaf back in 2020 - they shipped the wines and 3 were broken, no replacements, no refund no credit.  After that, I declined all future shipments as I could see they were disreputable.  I never got a notice prior to Jan 13 (the day they planned to ship).  I responded immediately only to get the run around from customer service who declined to cancel my order.  Their so called proof that i received notice is actually the proof that I attempted to cancel the order as is evident from the email history I am including below.  Once I told them I had disputed with my credit card company, they recalled the shipment and kept the wines, in addition they kept ALL OF my money.  They lied to the credit card company who informed me Firstleaf said we received the wine and never returned it.  I have lodged complaints with my credit card company, the Better Business Bureau and Facebook.  I'm going to write reviews everywhere I can find so other buyers don't get scammed like I did.
firstleaf	US	So excited to try this- but can't get my wine	03 February 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	So excited to try this, but fist shipment got sent back because it was broke, then the second one was sent so they say they started a label and Fed says they do not have it, first leaf says they do. Asked 1 of the 3 customer service reps I spoke with to call them while I waited and she said no. So frustrating especially when I was excited about the service and trying new wines i normally would not. They just let me walk away without trying to keep me. Wouldn't even let me talk to a manager that maybe could have handled it better! SOOO frusterating
firstleaf	US	WORST WINE CLUB	03 December 2020	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	WORST WINE CLUB!    Worst customer service.   I ordered on 11/29 and told wine would be delivered on 12/1.   It never came and tracking shows FedEx hasn’t received my box.   On 12/3, I was actually told my wine would be delivered on 12/1!    So, I guess they’ve developed a time machine.  The rep couldn’t tell me where my order was or if/when I would receive it.   His only solution was to cancel my order and membership.  Fine with me.  But, seriously, that’s not good or appropriate customer service and satisfaction at all.   Good riddance.Update 8/11/21LOL, so I posted my review in 12/20 and the company is just now responding and asking for a second chance?!?  Great response time!  LOL.   But, seriously, I would not give this company another chance.   It’s just not a good wine club.  And, that is evidenced by a multitude of bad reviews.   Yes, there are positive reviews out there.  But, if you do some digging, you’ll see the real reviews, which aren’t positive at all.   Not to mention, as others have stated, it’s not good wine and not a great deal.
firstleaf	US	Good Wine, Excellent service.	09 November 2020	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	All good. The wines are varied and tasty. The delivery is easy and well packed. In several years as a monthly member, I have had only one minor issue and the company quickly resolved it. Great communication and customer service.
firstleaf	US	NO!!	05 November 2020	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	"NO!!! Dont go there.  The first time i ordered, they left the package. Now they tell me because I have a job and cant be home to sign for it, I can't have it so now I have to pay a $20.00 ""restocking"" fee.  ARE YOU KIDDING ME.   I had to cancel my order because I have a job and the guy was basically useless helping me just reading from a manual.  So if you have a job, don't order because you apparently need to be unemployed to be able to accept.   Now I paid for wine I will never get and I have to pay them.  Just NO."
firstleaf	US	Firstleaf has been a good experience	04 July 2020	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	Firstleaf has been a good experience. I have only been a member for about 6 months, and so far, all good. I do think some of the wines are overpriced as I look up each and every wine when I receive. They do honor their guarantee and that says a lot about a company. The variety of wines is awesome and gives us a chance to try wines from all over the world. I will continue to order as needed and like the ability to delay shipments when needed. Thanks Firstleaf!
firstleaf	US	Excellent service and excellent wines	29 January 2020	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Excellent service and excellent wines! I tried other wine clubs before, but Firstleaf has been the best. Quality wines from all over the world. 😋

wineexpress	US	If I could give zero stars I would.	17 July 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	"If I could give zero stars I would.I ordered a bottle as a gift to be delivered in 7-10 days. The link to track my order on the website only said ""Your order has shipped."" After a few weeks, the intended recipient told me they never received the wine. Customer service said it was returned because of failed delivery attempts, even though I never received any notification that delivery attempts had been made. They then charged me for return shipping and restocking fees. They did offer to re-ship the wine, but then told me the bottle I ordered was no longer in stock. I asked if they could send a cheaper bottle from the same brand, they said no. I asked if they would send a new bottle when it's back in stock, they said no. It has now been too long for me to dispute the charge with my credit card company and they will do nothing more to help me. Their website is full of positive reviews, but there is nowhere on there or on Google to leave a review.I don't expect to get any money back from this, nor do I expect my aunt to actually get the wine I tried to send as a gift, but at least I can let others know not to order anything through WineExpress.com. They will take your money and run."

I have ordered lots of wine online and it is either delayed to cooler time of year or sent w dry ice.  I asked for refund and was told it might take a few hours.  Itâ€™s been days.  Will pursue w credit card company.
wineexpress	US	WineExpress: Run, Don't Walk, Away	12 August 2020	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	"WineExpress.com is ""the exclusive wine shop partner of The Wine Enthusiast catalog and website"".  As a first time buyer, I placed an order for an advertised wine. The website indicated ""Due to high temperatures, we are holding shipments in our temperature-controlled warehouse until it is safe to ship again"".  Absolutely right, especially where I live (Nevada) where it's triple digits daily this time of year.  I placed the order on a Saturday and, in an abundance of caution, emailed WineExpress verifying the shipment would be held.  Not receiving a response, I emailed again 2 days later on Monday morning.  Monday evening I received an email indicating my order shipped.  I emailed WineExpress asking why they shipped it in the heat despite their claim to hold it in a warehouse, and they replied the wine was being shipped in ""temperature-controlled vehicles"".   The wine was delivered 5pm on a Friday when the temperature was 112 degrees.  The UPS driver indicated that at no time had the shipment been in a ""temperature-controlled vehicle"" and he estimated his vehicle was at least 130 degrees.  Temperatures across most of the US during the almost week-long shipment from NY to NV were in the 90's and in triple digits during UPS local delivery runs.  Not surprisingly, when I opened the box, the bottles were very warm to almost hot.  Fine wine is damaged at prolonged temperatures above 80 degrees, and the temperature of these bottles were far above that.  I emailed WineExpress and, without apologizing or explaining why they indicated the wine was shipped in ""temperature-controlled vehicles"" when it obviously was not, WineExpress agreed to retrieve the damaged wine and issue a card credit by 8/4.  The damaged wine was retrieved (I'm wondering what poor hapless buyer will end up with it) but, despite an email on 8/7 indicating I hadn't received the credit without a response, I placed a dispute on the charge on 8/11 with my credit card company.  So, in apparent violation of its own policy not to ship due to high temperatures, and while ignoring my emails, WineExpress ships the order and tells me it was shipped in ""in temp controlled vehicles"" when it actually wasn't.  As a final insult, it then doesn't refund for a damaged order when they said they would, requiring me to dispute the charge with my credit card provider.  WineExpress exhibits incredibly poor business practices, treats customers poorly, and ends up wasting fine wine.  In sum, a very disappointing experience with WineExpress."

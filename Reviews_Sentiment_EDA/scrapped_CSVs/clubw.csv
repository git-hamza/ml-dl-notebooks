clubw	US	Placed orders without my permission	10 September 2015	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	They signed me up for some sort of club without my permission, and without notifying me and then made it really difficult to cancel an order that was not placed by me. Customer service rep kept changing her story over and over, didn't do what she said she would do (request the order to be returned to the warehouse), didn't own up to her mistakes and only after repeated requests finally agreed to request a refund for me.

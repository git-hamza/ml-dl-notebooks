NakedWines	GB	The best way to explore wine in a safe and helpful way.	19 September 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Everything about Naked Wines is excellent. Maybe the best thing to know for people wondering if to join up, is that from day one, you will be well treated, and the service really is first class. Oh, and, you'll get delicious wines whilst helping the small growers worldwide. I still buy some supermarket wine, but wonder why.

NakedWines	GB	Two Accounts Boomer	12 September 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I somehow created two accounts over the past 24 months - real boomer tech idiocy- never got round to sorting it out - finally did yesterday - the rep on the phone was brilliant- professional and engaging and very helpful,Two became one in 30 minutes !!!!Brilliant

NakedWines	GB	Back to prompt reliable deliveries 🎊	07 September 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Thank goodness Naked Wines have sorted out their delivery process. The previous two deliveries have taken an age to arrive resulting in me having to purchase elsewhere. As an Angel for over ten years I had grown used to getting my wine promptly, I am happy to say that my latest order arrived today after ordering just yesterday......
NakedWines	GB	The free vouchers are a CON	25 September 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	The free vouchers are a CON. When you send for your first free £75 voucher, you are then signed up to a monthly subscription of buying a full box of wine paying by direct debit in advance. The  you have to contact them to  stop the monthly subscription
NakedWines	GB	Great wines, good customer service, sensible pricing	07 August 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I like the Angel process. As a wine novice I find their descriptions helpful & accurate as I develop my knowledge of, and taste for wines. A great range of wines, excellent customer service, and well priced (for Angels).Really pleased I signed up.

When I used the voucher with Naked Wines I put in my basket  77£ of wine, + delivery 8£. So I have to buy 85£ of wine.... what a joke.. nevertheless on the site if you want to buy a good wine at a good price you need to be, ""Angel""....  Damn thieves...."
NakedWines	GB	Excellent Wine & Customer Service.	22 August 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Excellent Wine & Customer Service.Naked have an amazing choice of wines at all prices.I really like the Angel system, as I feel that this is a real benefit to small producers, allowing Naked to invest in them.Their customer service has been exemplary. The two times I have had a problem they have sorted it immediately and with no fuss.All in all I think that for me, the customer experience is one of the best.  I would highly recommend them.
NakedWines	GB	Good wine and great firm to deal with	28 July 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	"Responsive to contacting them via their AI bot. Their wines, which used to seem expensive, have now become a more acceptable price and the quality is above others available in the UK at similar prices. I like their Angel winemakers ""wall"" where they leave notes and videos of their vineyards and technical descriptions. I also like the regular 'free' gifts. Such as a Litre of special gin or a magnum of good quality wine that accompanies your order."
NakedWines	GB	'Heavenly' experience! lol	14 August 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I've been an 'Angel' for quite a while now and can't really fault anything. Good choice of product, nice occasional 'freebies', excellent delivery system and a stellar customer service team, particularly Lea(h)?. Thanks guys!
NakedWines	GB	Been a member for a number of years…	26 July 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Been a member for a number of years now, and rarely been even remotely with any of the offerings.It's clear that Naked Wines is getting more and more switched on to monetising each transaction. You log in, make your choices, then next process is to push a couple more bottles with another offer, then try and push a little more again.On the side I received an incentive to save £8 on the Christmas case if I stumped up a third of the payment now - hardly an incentive, although to be fair the offer is a  brilliant one!No need to pay £7.99 for delivery, your order will come quickly anyway.Still brilliant wines on offer
NakedWines	US	We are totally loving Naked Wines	01 August 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	We are totally loving Naked Wines.  The quality of what we have gotten is just incredible.  The shipping was phenomenal, great and safe box.  The price was outrageously reasonable.  I have not tastes wines of that quality for double the price per bottle, it is amazing.  We thoroughly enjoy our experience and the best things is the quality of the wines.  Cheers :)
NakedWines	GB	Great wine, great service and an easy-to-use website	20 July 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Rarely have we been disappointed with a bottle of wine from Naked Wines but, even then, there was nothing wrong with them, it was just a matter of taste. Almost always the wines are superb and we have found favourite producers to whom we return but, at the same time, taking the opportunity to try new ones. The easy-to-use website is a great help with making a selection. It could be labyrinthine but it is not and one is directed to new wines that are likely to be to your taste. Great service all round: you don't have to kiss a lot frogs to find your prince with Naked Wines.
NakedWines	GB	A great company	07 July 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	A great company; totally nailed it. Friendly, prompt service, lots of choice, lots of interactive stuff, helpful descriptions and pointers. And best of all - great wine (and you can feel virtuous while you drink it, in the knowledge that you're helping some small, independent wine companies).
NakedWines	GB	I received a voucher from another…	20 September 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I received a voucher from another online company for my loyalty. When I used the voucher with Naked Wines they have rejected my order due to my partner having used them about 5 years ago.I am DISGUSTED with Naked Wines and was considering using them in the future as I was under the impression that they had been taken over by Majestic wines and did not exist anymore.They are NOT a reputable company and what is the point of another company giving me a voucher for my loyalty if they do not honour it.A DISGUSTED  FUTURE CUSTOMER !!!!!!!!!!!!!

NakedWines	GB	drink naked wine	22 July 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	My wife purchased some items from another company, she received a voucher from naked wines, I had a look the wines seem to be good value( lots of tasting to come). Free delivery plus a free bottle win win
NakedWines	GB	Beautiful wines from lovely people	18 June 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I recently joined naked wines, as my husband seemed to turn into a connoisseur overnight, and I wanted to know where all the amazing wines appeared from! And I am super happy with every aspect of the experience. Great wines, great customer service, great value..no more disappointing supermarket wines at inflated prices..just beautiful made wines offered at great prices. They recommend wines that I might like and if I don't like something..its easily remedied.I can't recommend them highly enough.
NakedWines	GB	The business model is great allowing…	03 June 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	The business model is great allowing talented winemakers to make and sell great wines at affordable prices. I think they offer far superior wines to the supermarkets and other wine merchants at similar price points. Having studied at WSET to diploma level many years ago and tasted thousands of bottles in the last 30 years I really find it hard to believe some of the negative comments on here. One can only assume they are in opposition to Naked wines. A big thank you to the Naked team.
NakedWines	GB	I bought my first case over 12mths ago…	15 July 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I bought my first case over 12mths ago due being given  a £80 off a case offer..and I have never looked back. The wines are outstanding and the service is too....on the  very odd occasion I haven't liked a wine I was given a refund no quibble but out of I think 5 cases i have only not fully enjoyed 2 bottles. And when you think about the duffers we buy in supermarkets that is outstanding in its self. I recommend NW to anyone!!

NakedWines	GB	What not to like!	22 May 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Great wine, fantastic service, strong ethics, good prices and quick delivery. What not to like! I’ve enjoyed trying different wines and love being able to reserve a case of my favourites in advance. I even get ridiculously excited when I know it’s on its way!
NakedWines	GB	Beware of Shady Sales Practices	14 September 2023	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	Wines are mostly pretty good, I've been an 'Angel' for a year or two and never received a wine I didn't enjoy enough to request a refund. But last week I received an email from Matt, Wine Guy along the lines of Reply 'YES' to let our Wine Genie build a custom case for your personal taste buds. I thought great, I've got a fair bit of credit in my account and I'm interested in what the algorithm will pick for me, so I replied 'YES'.Nowhere in the email did it say this was essentially a whole new subscription, except in a vague P.S. Nowhere in the email did it specify a price. I just received an email a few days later with a bunch of Sales spiel and a sheepish 'there may be a slight issue with your card' when they attempted to charge it for an amount I still don't know.Like many companies they're very keen to hold on to subscribers, so will offer all manner of vouchers and discounts to keep you. But beware, they're not above essentially conning you into paying more later down the line. Unless you don't care about, transparency, value for money, or creeping subscription prices, would recommend avoiding them.
NakedWines	GB	The club has become too commercially orientated	17 September 2023	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	We have had some nice wines but unfortunately I have had several problems with deliveries. The delivery company Yodel seem to think that if they can drop the wines outside someones house in the general area that is good enough. How can they take a photo of the delivery when the house number is clearly in view and doesn't match the correct delivery address? And then provide that as proof of delivery?  Other delivery problems include missed delivery days, not left in the correct 'safe place' and (apparently) broken bottles meaning a further delayed delivery. Along with these problems there are the recent increases in prices of wine and delivery minimum spend has increased and  a specific day can no longer be specified without payment. I also feel that the club ethos of the company has diminished and it now feels more of a commercial enterprise. Overall I am no longer happy enough with the service to continue subscribing and will buy my wines elsewhere.
NakedWines	GB	Good prices and decent wine	19 August 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Good prices and decent wine. Delivery has always been on time. Will continue to purchase my wine here again.
NakedWines	GB	Great wine, great service and great knowledge.	13 July 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I love Naked Wines. The choice of wines are fantastic and there is good interaction with the company and producers. I don't but as often as I did as I am trying to be a good boy and not drink so much wine in the week when I have to work the next day. I would not hesitate to recommend to anyone.

We haven't had a disappointing wine yet and the monthly money you save up with them helps support smaller wine producers around the globe. Fantastic.
NakedWines	GB	Every order of wine I've purchased  has…	13 May 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Every order of wine I've purchased  has been delivered  earlier  than said it would  be.  great wine never had a bad one best wine company  around tried couple of other wines company's  like virgin and took five weeks for wine to come as there delivery  company   mislaid  wine . Naked wine is the one to buy from if you want good wine
NakedWines	GB	Quick response to problem ordering.	21 July 2023	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	Wasted my time and money registering as an Angel and expecting to be able to order wine. However it seems they do not want my business. No response to emails.All sorted now and swift response from Naked wines.
NakedWines	US	I am stunned at the negative reviews	18 February 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I am stunned at the negative reviews!  The wines are excellent and fairly, if not generously priced.  My deliveries always arrive within a day or two, well packaged.  I agreed to have a monthly charge on my card, I was not blindsided by this, nor was I coerced in any way - I simply read and understood the offer.  No hidden fees, no hard sell, clear pricing, and very pleasant emails with special offers.
NakedWines	GB	Good wine at a decent price at a time…	01 March 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Good wine at a decent price at a time when supermarket offerings are creeping up. Delivered when they say it will be. But it's a bigger experience than that. You help small producers to survive, in return they tell you about their wines, what's happening in their vineyards, maybe just a great shot of the sunrise. If you respond a conversation starts. (I have an open invitation to lunch in Spain!) It's a community, there's no hard sell. Works for me!
NakedWines	GB	Placement of first order	29 August 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Pending receipt and tasting of wine, the online experience so far has been good.
NakedWines	GB	Friendly efficient service as usual.	16 March 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Staff are easy to contact by phone and are friendly and helpful. Wines are good to very good, for the price.  It’s a worthy enterprise supporting small wine makers starting out with a passion for good wine. To those reviewers here complaining about having to subscribe on a monthly basis, please note you do keep the money, it’s still yours, it mounts up until you want to order a case.  There is no pressure or time limit on your spending.
NakedWines	NG	I got a good discount on a case of wine and cancelled my subscription effortlessly	09 May 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I got a good discount on a case of wine I ordered for my husbands birthday. I was abit disappointed that with did not arrive on time but that was partly my fault. its said delivery in 1 to 4 days, it was derived on day 4. However the wine was good. I did not realise I had become and Angel by accepting the discount vouchers, I had no intentions of becoming an Angel. I am giving a high positive review because of the ease at which I was able to cancel the Angel subscription. it's usually a nightmare to cancel this online implied subscription. Nakedwines should go one step further and ask people if the want to join rather than add them automatically.
NakedWines	AU	CUSTOMER SERVICE EXEMPLIFIED Naked have a unique concept to assist…	12 March 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Naked have a unique concept to assist small boutique wineries. They have fantastic vignerons producing great wines. The communication from Naked and interaction with the winemakers is exceptional. My favourites are Cabernet Sauvignon from Coby Ludwig with his Lovers Grave and Gary Stokes and his My Other Self range. The Small & Small Sauvignon Blanc from the Marlborough is my pick of the whites. Thanks Naked - Gary Justin
NakedWines	GB	The Website is very intuitive	08 July 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	The Website is very intuitive, good range with some videos to explain all about the wine and the farms the are produced. Also i can defiantly say that the wine Angles give good discounts to that of any stores.
NakedWines	GB	Excellent company	25 May 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Excellent company. Fantastic customer service. Had a bit of trouble with an order that was not actually mine and sorted quickly and with generosity. You can always tell huge amounts about a company from the way they resolve problems - this was top customer service. Thank you. Highly recommended company
NakedWines	GB	Even when you leave, they are great!	21 March 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Sadly, I just cancelled my Naked Wines subscription after many years, as I am leaving the UK. Cancelling was very easy and took less than 5 minutes. They refunded my outstanding balance.Throughout the time I've been with Naked Wines, they have been easy and pleasant to deal with. I would definitely renew upon return to the UK.
NakedWines	GB	Great wines at good prices	18 April 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Great wines at good prices - massive selection so nice to try different grapes - super helpful team and special offers. Really nice to hear stories from the vineyards and wine makers. Thoroughly recommend them

My only gripe is the yodel delivery service used but it does seem they took feedback on board last Xmas and now swapped. Great work. Kat skeavington
NakedWines	GB	5 Star Service	20 March 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I got a case of their wines at a discounted rate by using a discount voucher of £75 to try them, having been a long standing Laithwates customer. The wines were mostly good to very good and I certainly think I will be able to fine tune a selection to my taste when I buy again.I'm not a fan of the £25 a month scheme so called them to opt out of it, expecting a battle, but was really pleasantly surprised by the level of customer service, hence the 5 star review. No hassle, no long forms or attempt to make it difficult to leave, just a simple conversation and that was it. 100% I shall be back to buy a case or 2 when I'm ready.
NakedWines	GB	I don’t usually write reviews but after…	22 May 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I don’t usually write reviews but after seeing some negative comments recently I just wanted to share my experience with Naked wines.  My wife has been an Angel for years, the service is excellent and the knowledge of the staff who have recommended wine to us has been fantastic. The wines are exceptional and we have not had a bad one yet, far superior quality than the supermarket wine we used to buy. I’m so impressed I’ve become an Angel myself😀
NakedWines	ES	Love them as a company	31 May 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Love them as a company . Most professional too. Great , easy website to navigate . No hidden costs. Fab wine . Highly recommend them. Everyone who likes wine should join! .
NakedWines	GB	Worlds best wine company	26 May 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I have only the highest praise for naked wines, it is so refreshing to purchase great wines from a company whose ethics and ethos are so very good and decent, in an ever darker world this sort of business model must be supported, their staff who are always so helpful and kind, real actual human beings on the other end of the phone, and a no quibble replacement on any bottle of wine you do not like, Incredible!! just incredible!! I raise a glass to your continued success
NakedWines	GB	Awesome	18 February 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Had a great time with Naked Wines - used it for many years and never any issue, got great wines!But what impressed me the most is that I just decided to cancel the subscription - not because I didn't like them but because I simply have too many bottles and haven't been drinking much anymore - and I must say I'm really impressed that they made it a super smooth, simple process including a straight forward option to return credits I had. I wish all companies did this! Kudos for a really great way to treat your customers, to the very end. Will definitely return when my stash is gone ;-)
NakedWines	GB	I decided to stop my Naked wine account…	13 March 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I decided to stop my Naked wine account some time ago (nothing to do with the Company), but something went wrong.  When my credit card expired, the account became dormant so they sent me wine to the value of my account.  I queried this and said I’d prefer the money back.  They have excelled with truly exceptional customer service.  The wine collected free of charge, lots of friendly emails, they cancelled the account, all I had to do was upload my details for the refund.  I would recommend them 100%
NakedWines	GB	We've used Naked wines for the last 3…	01 April 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	We've used Naked wines for the last 3 years and had a great experience. The wines are always delicious, I don't think we've had a single one we didn't like. I like the flexibility of paying in a fixed amount every month and then cashing it in whenever I'm ready. We often get free bottles added to our basket, and once it had been a while since we ordered so they contacted us and put together a bespoke crate of wines according to our tastes recorded in our wine profile. Had one issue (our fault) where the crate went to the wrong address, and had a new one delivered to us within a matter of days. Options to pause for a couple of months which we've used a few times when we have plenty of wine left or are a bit short on cash. We're leaving the UK for a while so have had to cancel now, but when we get back I'm sure we'll sign up again :)
NakedWines	GB	Fantastic service	20 July 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Fantastic service, great value for money. Love the quality of the wines. Delivery is always prompt.Would highly recommend if you love your wines.
NakedWines	GB	I have subscribed for a few months and…	13 February 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I have subscribed for a few months and am more than happy with the service. I feel that their strategy or processes are transparent and it's very easy /seamless to change (or even cancel) the monthly subscription with no heavy sales pitch or coercion to continue. Some years ago, before I knew anything about Naked, we had a mis-delivered case of wine to our address. We were very honest and contacted them. They couldn't have been more helpful and told us to take any bottle and to leave the rest out for collection. Sure enough a delivery driver turned up as promised. I think this reflects their 'niceness' to customers and it is one of the reasons I have now subscribed (along with an incentive via a friend!).
NakedWines	GB	Very easy website navigate and use	11 August 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Very easy website navigate and use, quick delivery dates too. Great special deals and offers
NakedWines	GB	I’ve been a massive fan of Naked Wines…	05 April 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I’ve been a massive fan of Naked Wines for some time now and I’ve always recommend them to our guests when we host our blind wine tasting evenings - and of course we always use naked wines for our entertaining evenings and they never disappoint! Great to order from a company we can rely on! Many thanks Carl The Wine Suite 🍷
NakedWines	GB	Top red wine & customer support	02 February 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I've changed this review from 1 to 5 stars as the replies from Naked WInes were prompt and all good but got lost in my Spam folder. So my mistake - 5 starts covers the customer service and great red wine selection (in particular)
NakedWines	GB	I do not understand the negative…whats not to like	12 June 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I do not understand the negative comments about Naked Wines. The model seems great to me. I pay £30 per month and then order a case every quarter, adding a bit more in at Xmas. Always nice and well priced wines (the only bad one bottle was a free large bottle at Xmas - so no complaints there). Easy to order, lots of choice, always turns up on time. Brilliant.
NakedWines	GB	First class quality wine delivered to you door	28 April 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Been a customer for years and have had many cases and special offers. Easily the best wine we've had, much higher quality than the usual shop bought stuff. The mixed cases are great for trying new wines and the Xmas hamper is a must. The angel scheme is great idea and makes the cases more affordable. Only ever had to contact them a couple of times and the service was spot on.
NakedWines	GB	Used this service for a few years now…	14 August 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Used this service for a few years now good wines no hassel , good prices. If you really don't like a wine they will swop any problems they deal with.

NakedWines	GB	Have been with Naked Wines for years…	24 March 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Have been with Naked Wines for years and I cannot speak more highly. Fabulous selection of wines, very friendly and helpful staff and wonderful opportunity to experience some excellent wines.  I save up for the Christmas Box each year!
NakedWines	US	Unbelievable customer service	31 January 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Unbelievable customer service! We have received two prior shipments of wine and have been pleasantly impressed. We placed a third order but immediately after placing the order we realized we forgot to change the delivery address since we recently moved. We got in an online chat to change the delivery address and emailed the issue to them. Unfortunately our order was delivered to our old address. Errors were made at both ends but Naked Wines are shipping us a replacement order for no extra charge. I'm almost embarrassed by their generosity but it certainly wins me over as loyal customer.
NakedWines	GB	try something different…	14 March 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	if you'd like to try something different...give Naked a try.Wines you just don't find anywhere else, very helpful ratings system, swift and reliable delivery service (Yodel)
NakedWines	GB	Just received my delivery	31 March 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Just received my delivery, thank you. Order always left as per delivery instructions and on the day it’s expected. Been a member now for well over 10 yrs and have always had great wines and excellent customer service.
NakedWines	GB	EXCELLENT HIGH QUALITY WINES AT GREAT PRICES WITH ACE APP AND PERSONAL SERVICE	27 January 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	JUST FANTASTIC! Been using for sometime, and at the beginning had running with Virgin wines and other providers. Naked Wines are by FAR the best, the wines are great, both in quality and price.
NakedWines	GB	Excellent customer service and value	14 July 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Love Naked Wines customer service and everything they stand for. Great value for money and love supporting independent winemakers.
NakedWines	GB	Excellent wine	06 March 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Excellent wine. Delivery good. Cost is fair I feel. A number of negative reviews here don't really appreciate what this company is about.Basically it's a wine clubYou pay £20 ( or what you choose) per month When you have enough in your account you order the wine you want.The up front cost every month goes to fund winemakers. If you decide not to buy the wine you can ask for your money to be returned.There is no automatic 3 monthly delivery - you only get the wine you want.If been a member for 3-4 years It suits are needs perfectly
NakedWines	GB	Just perfect every single time	01 June 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	"There is literally nothing bad to say about them, regardless of how ""fussy"" some might be! I've been ordering from them for a few months - the orders have always been incredibly quick (for example, I ordered yesterday and the order arrived today, with no extra fees for delivery), they always follow my instructions and always contact me directly in case of any issues caused by the delivery company (which only happened once and they replaced my case, without even being asked!). The prices are amazing, wines come from small independent businesses and the website is so easy to use! Absolutely perfect experience every single time, friendly and professional team!"
NakedWines	GB	Customer service legend!	08 February 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I want to say a huge THANK YOU to Jen, whom I had the pleasure of speaking to today.Honestly the best customer service I have EVER had from ANY company.She is honestly a great CS person to have working for you! She was personable, attentive, and very kind.A million thanks again Jen!
NakedWines	GB	Disappointing customer service	18 March 2023	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	We’ve had a few deliveries from Naked and they have arrived as stated and not yet found a wine we didn’t like.However our last delivery did not arrive in slot given so we were given another slot for the following day (late evening) It eventually arrived over an hour and a half late at 10.30pm. On contacting Naked to make them aware of this issue I was told that the delivery had arrived within the timescale the company worked to and it was up to me to make a complaint with the delivery company. Not what I was expecting from a company that had always turned out first class customer service
NakedWines	GB	What great customer service	14 March 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	What great customer service A lovely refreshing change to have my requests met . Other companies would do well to follow their example .
NakedWines	GB	Good wine and a satisfactory outcome.	06 February 2023	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	Good wine but hugely overpriced. Read the small print before ordering. And don't fall for their special offers which according to my experience are not what they are made out to be. I ordered 18 bottles of wine but ended up with just 14 and they told me that included a surplus of £15 which was already on the account.The bottom line is I was offered 18 random bottles of bin-end wines and the line given was “to help the manager out”, but I have received just 14 bottles which included a £15 payment surplus on my account. So I have been swindled out of FOUR bottles of wine.* Since writing this revue the company has corrected the situation by supplying four more bottles of wine. Their swift response is appreciated and I have therefore upgraded my revue.
NakedWines	GB	No no and NO	08 September 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	The website is hard to use. I got £80 discount but when choosing the wines upto £80 there is no discount. The way it works is that you spend like £100 and you will make £80 saving so the wine was originally £80. You cant just go and buy £80 worth of wine and pay nothing. No wonder so many of these discounts flying around every week. Discount disguised.

NakedWines	NL	Really bad batch of German whites	16 August 2023	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	Really bad batch of German whites, Germany has a wine quality system that works, and these guys tried to pick up  low by ranking quality wines but you could tell they had no idea. Also grape type is vital in a German wine and these were most mongrel. Like the England can't beat Germany in a penalty shootout out, foreign buyers can't find bargains in German wines the quality system is too good.

NakedWines	GB	Great Wines and great community	15 February 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I’m not currently a Naked Wine ‘angel’ purely down to taking a break while tightening belts but I would go back.I wanted to leave a review having read the negative reviews that amazed me. People who do not read in full what naked wines are and what they do shouldn’t really be leaving reviews claiming they’ve been scammed! It is and always has been very clear that naked wines is a club where you pay a monthly amount of your choice and when you’re ready you buy your next case with the money you’ve paid in that’s what you do. Most cases are free delivery too.  Simple! Throughout my subscription I changed my monthly payment to suit my means. When I decided that sadly I need to hang up my wings for a while I simply let Naked Wines know and they refunded my account balance within 48hrs no hassle at all. With regards to the wines, they are great and they are nicer than equivalent value supermarket wines for sure with the discount. I’ve never had a terrible wine, some are amazingly some are just good. I’ve been refunded for wines NW decided weren’t their usual quality without me even contacting them so they do listen and clearly if enough members weren’t happy a blanket refund was given. I’ve had two ‘mix ups’ in my time with them and both resolved instantly with a quick call or email and on both occasion I received an account credit for the error as an apology. I couldn’t be happier with them and look forward to the remedial work on my house being complete so I can repurchase my wings!
NakedWines	GB	Beware of offers	17 August 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Naked wines sent me a personal e-mail offering a FREE bottle of wine, when I tried to redeemed this I was told sorry this was not really meant for you. With great reluctance they offered to let me have the bottle if I ordered  full case!! Their customer service team is an oxymoron as they are certainly not customer orientated. I now find that I can get just as good a wine  at a far better price from M&S
NakedWines	GB	Starts wells but quality drops as you stay, dissspointing. I as I used to trust them.	30 July 2023	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	Some of the wines provided were excellent, however when you place an order they will replace your selection with lesser wines but not reduce the charge ( if I want 14% 13 or 13.5 is not a replacement). And sadly I had 3 deliveries containing a bottle of what tasted like germolene, not wine. First bottle of germolene,I received a refund, the others were did not offer a means of refund,It seemed until I revisited my order,I was then offered the option for the bottle in question to ask for a refund (sadly after I posted my initial review). The refund was offered immediately onto my account. It seemed after the initial joining period, quality dropped. Sad as the initial wines were superb! After that only a few were. I have now cancelled my subscription.

NakedWines	GB	DELIVERY	25 August 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Let me begin by the wine is absolutely fine no problems with that.However, I am at a loss as to why the company are continuing to use a courier who is highly UNRELIABLE! Despite having been made aware on several occasions of the courier not following the process for when we are not at home.Our delivery instructions are clear , as are the instructions from naked wine to the courier even making sure that they are printed on the delivery label. Yet not once but what is now a REGULAR occurrence the courier chooses to ignore them and leaves the wine on our front doorstep in full view! That is alot of money sitting there for any passers-by to see!I  am once again waiting for the explanation, and what will be I expect, an empty promise. Think long and hard before you consider placing an order if your delivery is  required to be secure!!!Watch this space.
NakedWines	GB	Scam subscriptions	22 July 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	We were really happy with our previous purchases. Then straight after we placed an order the company plundered our bank account and took another £100 without our knowledge. Apparently we had another subscription that we don’t even know about. Checked through all emails and have no notification of this. Absolutely furious at these scam subscriptions that so many companies have these days. I thought this company was different but clearly not. Very upset indeed.

NakedWines	GB	'Great Wine, Dreadful Delivery experience'	09 August 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I can only echo a previous review - delivery service IS dreadful...Am a longstanding Naked Wine customer - loving the wine - but patience is wearing VERY thin with the delivery experience -EVERY TIME, wine box is dumped in full public view on the front step, with a quick knock and back in the van & off without a backward glance - this (even on one occasion when were not just out but away for a few days) & DESPITE....- marketing promises to leave in a 'safe place'- me detailing the safe place, very clearly & in capital letters, on every order- e.mails confirming the wine will be left in the safe place & not to worry about being out- previous conversations and promises to put things right next timePlease either change your promise, to say that wine will always be left in a very UNSAFE place, or preferably (because I do love the wine) get a grip on your delivery company - customers will surely be lost otherwise.

NakedWines	GB	Great wines. Terrible delivery experiences.	05 August 2023	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	The wines themselves are great however Naked Wines choose to use Yodel as their delivery provider and Yodel are so completely unreliable that the last two orders I placed showed up days later than promised. Naked Wines aren't really concerned about the inconvenience this causes for people with Yodel providing false delivery updates. My recent order was so late that the party I ordered the wine for would have been a 'dry' one had my guests not come to the rescue.
NakedWines	GB	Took money without my permission	21 August 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I have tried to resolve this issue with the company over the phone and via email but no-one has contacted me back therefore leaving a review here. Apparently 13 months ago, July 2022, I signed up to receiving new stock of a certain wine. In the meantime, having forgotten, I stopped using the account completely & the email associated with it was deregistered from the domain provider. 13 months later (mid August 2023) a few days before pay day I was unexpectedly deducted £75 from my account which caused me financial issues. I first contacted them by email on the Saturday and phoned them on the Monday morning. The lady I spoke to was completely unsympathetic and whilst cancelled the order and processed a refund, no-one called me back as requested. Naked Wines do not seem to understand that taking money (a significant amount) from someone for something they have not positively opted into in for over a year is really, really bad practice and destroys trust in a company. I was told I was emailed about the order, but the email account did not exist so they would have had an undeliverable message and yet still took the money. So in the absence of any follow up from Naked Wines all I can do is make others aware. I now need to make sure they have deleted my payment details as I don't trust them.
NakedWines	GB	DO NOT ORDER 🤬🤬🤬	20 July 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	If I could give ZERO stars I would. Please do NOT be taken in by this SCAM company. I received an unexpected case of Wine and money was taken from my credit card. Despite numerous emails (of course you can not contact them by phone) explaining I did NOT ask and NOT want to receive the Wines they have STILL not refunded my money. Apparently I ordered a case over two years ago and allegedly I’d signed up for a future offer. They used an old email address of mine which I never use anymore. . For ages. This was to inform me they had taken my money and my case was on the way. They did collect the wine a few weeks ago but still no call and no refund. IF YOU WANT TO BE SCAMMED OUT OF A LOT OF MONEY THEN PLEASE GO AHEAD  AND ORDER. You WILL regret it. They have our bank details, our mobile, our email and still no response on why we have still not got our money back.

Then I get an email from Trustpilot saying that I should follow up directly with the company.Why are Naked wines so prompt at replying to my complaint on Trustpilot and so slow to reply to me in person?Why say that they are trying to track me down when they have my email address and phone number?They are much more interested in a good appearance on Trustpilot than actual helping.Yet another day goes by and no communication at all.A week has gone by now.

NakedWines	GB	Wine quality down, inflation up	11 May 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	"Ordered six bottles of red with their offer.  Can't say the quality was that great - Waitrose has better selection.  Feel that even though the initial order is discounted their list price is above what a similar standard wine would cost.   Also given their inventory is getting stale there is a risk of getting ""past-it"" wines.  Meanwhile obviously there is no inflation protection in tbe angel - why pay 25 quid a month and build up a wine balance when you are not earning any interest on it... You can earn 5% in the bank!"

However I don't appreciate this approach and feel like i was tricked into joining something i did not want to or intend to. - Wine delivery is due tomorrow. I'm hoping it's good.

NakedWines	GB	The wines are OK but service can be hit and miss	28 July 2023	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	The wines are fine but service is poor. The wines are nothing particularly special and, as a new customer, I think their marketing is over-hyped. I have decided that their piggy-bank model of advanced monthly payments is not for me and so I want to cancel my account. Now the problems really begin. There is no way to cancel your account online. They insist that you call their landline. I have just done this to be told by recorded message that their phone number is closed as they try to catch up with emails. So, no way to cancel right now at all and I don't want my card charged. I have sent them emails on this but they take ages to reply. My trust in them as a reliable business is broken on this.Updated: --- The reply below from Naked Wines should be read in context that they have not replied personally to any of my emails sent to them today, nor do they let me phone them as their line is closed. The note from customer services I received first thing this morning indicated that I could cancel online, which I cannot as the web page they indicate has no button for this function. If they really want to solve this issue then they should take the initiative and cancel my account and let me know that this has been done. Simple. Let's see if they actually do anything.Update 2: They have now cancelled my account as I had requested, which is good. To reiterate, the wines are fine, albeit nothing exceptional, and the delivery seems to work fine too. They just dropped the ball on the service front. They did take action in the end but it shouldn't really have taken so much effort on my part, but never mind. I have updated to 3 stars and revised the title as the issue is now sorted.
NakedWines	GB	Dreadful delivery service…	15 May 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Great wines but their delivery company Yodel are truly awful. Waited in all afternoon for two cases of wine. Naked wines contacted me later in the afternoon to say that my second case had been damaged and would not be delivered. They neglected to tell me that my ‘first’ case wouldn’t be delivered either! I am still waiting for confirmation when, and if, the two cases will be delivered. Waiting for 24 hours for an email response is unacceptable.Like other clients, sadly I am going to cancel my subscription. There are other great wine suppliers out there!
NakedWines	GB	Really terrible wines	28 April 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Really terrible wines! I tried a few and each one was bitter and headache-inducing after one glass. Initially tried a mixed case at Christmas and it was all truly terrible. Didn't realise they were taking money out of my account for a couple of months but decided to try some more and then cancel. I picked some of my favourite wine varieties (albarino, nz sauv blanc) and they have all been  thrown away after one glass, I wouldn't even use them for cooking they are disgusting.Have cancelled my subscription. Would not recommend!!!

Without the discount the bottles would have cost anything from £9-16. These wines were disgusting, they had a kind of perfumed taste and the Sauvignon Blanc didn’t taste anything like the grape. Any supermarket wines with a regular price of £5-7 a bottle would be far superior. Still got 3 bottles left which we will throw away.

NakedWines	GB	A very disappointed Angel	08 July 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Sitting in all day again waiting for the same order from Naked Wines, that  was due to be delivered on a Saturday  3 weeks ago. On the 17th June, the order was not sent out. On the 24th June the Yodel delivery guy dropped and smashed the entire box of wine on my doorstep. Now today 8th July all notifications disappeared on the Yodel tracker and Naked Wine, when supposedly it was 5 stops away. I don't know what is going on here, but I am beyond Angry. I was to be hosting a wine party on the 20th July for colleagues, that will now have to be canceled. ( Making me look completely incompetent). Another order I have paid for that is due next Saturday 15th July, will regrettably have to also be canceled. All trust with Naked Wines has now gone. It's a shame, as I have had no problem with deliveries until this order. The two orders have cost me over £200. Sooo disappointing.

NakedWines	GB	Sitting here laughing	19 July 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Sitting here laughing. I spend a decent amount on wine.  I received another Naked Wines marketing email, this time about paying them in advance for a Christmas case of wines which they don’t name so you’re buying blind and paying in instalments which puts cash in their account long before you get any wine. I did a Google search to see if I could find out what last years wines were. Nope. Then I saw a critical article of Naked Wines talking about their monthly subscription. So I checked, and lo and behold, apparently I have been paying them £25 per month to allow them to send me marketing emails offerings discounts that I have already paid for! Brilliant! If I was this good at conning people I would have a large wine business!I don’t miss 25 quid a month hence why I didn’t know I was paying them. I do hate duplicitous conniving little marketing schemes however so Naked Wines, goodbye. And btw, don’t try to sell me wines without telling me what you will provide. Anyone dumb enough to miss the fact that you will send the highest gross margin wines possible is just not bright enough.Nice try. Now take a running jump. I am quite happy to keep buying en primeur (and drinking wines) via the Wine Society - an ethical business that values wine and customer over profit and marketing.
NakedWines	GB	Misleading advertising	07 April 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Misleading advertising. I ordered the spring case which showed a variety of wines. But when it was delivered none of the wines pictured were in the case, I received multiple bottles of the same wines which I wouldn't have ordered had I been openly informed that's what's in the case. I think the website is purposefully set up to be misleading and difficult to end your subscription.

NakedWines	GB	Automatic deductions	13 February 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Like some other reviewers here, I was astonished to find that £25 has been taken out of my bank account every month with absolutely no prior notice. When I called to complain, my complaint was dealt with promptly, but I was told that the reason for that was that some of the wines I had previously ordered were only for 'angels', but that's not correct, because the ones I was able to order (my first and only order) did NOT include angel wines.I will be VERY careful going forward. I wonder how many other people are in the same boat and don't routinely check their bank accounts?

Obviously thought it was fine to leave it with him? As he was driving off I picked up box which collapsed as I lifted it into hall due to a smashed bottle of wine inside it making it wet.

NakedWines	GB	SCAM, keep away!	11 May 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I received a discount voucher. I placed an order. I just wanted to buy the wine I was offered, BUT I found out that: 1) I could not remove my credit card, 2) I could not cancel my order, 3) I had actually signed up (the small print) for a membership and have to pay £25 per month in addition to my purchase. The only way to cancel is calling them, I did 10 minutes after placing my order, but the refund will only be made in a week's time instead of IMMEDIATELY as it should. 4.4 Trustpilot? I will not be trusting this website again.
NakedWines	GB	Very poor service	23 June 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	"Very poor service. Their delivery amateurs leave boxes of wine exposed in the sun and rain despite our delivery instructions to ""leave by back door under canopy"" and large signs by our front door to ""Leave parcels around back under canopy"" and Naked !""£$ do nothing about it and the next delivery is left in exactly the same place, on the front step in full view of anyone passing and completely exposed to all weathers. All made worse by the adolescent and patronising language in every missive by ""Ray, the wine guy"" as though we are all of kinder garden age - everyone of them makes me want to puke! And to cap it all, when you want to cancel your account, whatever you have in the pot is reduced by a £10 ""admin fee"" even though they have had the use of your money for months. ""Ray the Charlatan"" is more like it frankly. Lol! And now we have ""Neil the customer happiness guy"" patronising me."

NakedWines	GB	Wrong wine bottles, exhorbitant price.	11 April 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	What went wrong: (1) I received a £75 Naked Wines gift voucher but when I went to the website to redeem it for 12 bottles of RED wines, I was required to pay another £84. I was assured that I was making a saving! Total of £159 for 12 bottles. (2) The case of wines arrived; I opened it the next day - it contained 6 reds and 6 whites! (3) Their emails guide me how to invite people to join as ANGELS, but not how to rectify problems. Okay, I admit: I chose to buy the wines as a guest rather than register. I did not want to get hooked into a subscription before I know what Naked Wines are. How can Naked Wines improve? (1) Please send RED wines when a guest customer selects only red wines (2) Provide options for feedback so that guest customers can contact you; maybe issues can be resolved amicably without washing your dirty linens in public? (3) Introductory wines should be cheaper or you will scare promising customers like me away.
NakedWines	GB	Appalling delivery service	05 April 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	For the second time I have been notified that a delivery was made to a neighbour but not specified where. This despite instructions for case to be left at side gate On the last occasion the case was never traced and a neighbour clearly had a windfall or perhaps the delivery driver! Despite the excellence of the wine I intend to cancel my subscription after many years unless this error is remedied satisfactorily.I have also registered previous complaints where delivery has required me at 86 years of age to carry case when driver would not leave it at my door when I was in residenceI have been asked to clarify. I am currently away from home and wil,respond on my return next week in the hope that the case by then may have mysteriously reappeared

NakedWines	GB	Fake £75 voucher, waste of time.	14 April 2023	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Got a £75 voucher to spend on a case of wine.  After wasting 15 minutes of my life signing up and browsing, it turns out that the £75 voucher is only redeemable against a £145 box.  In other words I have to spend £70 on 12 bottles of wine that I don't want or need.  If the £75 voucher was genuine, I may have shopped and bought some bottles at my discretion.  But this is a complete scam, just giving me a false discount to get me to spend money on stuff I didn't ask for.

NakedWines	GB	Buyer beware... I felt tricked (but not cheated)	09 June 2023	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	"I bought a case of wine with a £75 off voucher but felt deceived by the way my card was used. The signup process referred once to becoming an Angel but did not expand on what that meant. I was suspicious so I read the Terms and Conditions before I signed up: under the sections on vouchers, item 3 says, ""They're also for one-off purchases only i.e. you're not required to join any type of wine club when redeeming your voucher (although we will invite you to become an Angel!)"". Reassured that I wasn't committing to an ongoing expensive, I purchased my box. But I was still suspicious so I logged on, went to Subscriptions, saw nothing explicit but noticed a small button marked Angels... I clicked this and finally found out I had been signed up to a £25 per month club without my explicit consent. Furthermore; you can't unsubscribe from Angels, there's a telephone number you have to call. By now I am feeling tricked. I called the number, resisted the polite pressure to not cancel and the undertones of, ""you should have known you were signing up to Angels"" (did he mean I was lying or that I was stupid?). I also checked to make sure I would get an email confirming the cancelation (cos, yes, they had lost my trust). And finally I logged back onto my account only to find that I can only remove my card details if I add another card, even though my account is cancelled.The whole experience was like the line in Hotel California, ""you can check out any time you like but you can never leave"". The wine may be good and the guy I spoke to was polite (hence 2 stars), and I might actually use them again if the wine I get is good and worth the (full) price but I am left feeling tricked... and that is an off-putting customer experience."

I have then received an e mail saying that my order has been cancelled as I was a previous customer!  Just appalling marketing and customer service.
NakedWines	GB	Trustworthy	15 January 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Aside from enjoying the service and range of wines on offer, the thing that impressed me the most was how easy it is to cancel membership, which I'm doing for financial reasons.It was simple to find where to do this, and there were easy alternatives offered (reducing or pausing monthly payments). When I selected to cancel, it let me know that the money already in my Angels account would be refunded to my payment card. I'd expected to have to spend that money in their store so it was a pleasant surprise to find out that I would be refunded without me having to do anything. It's made me trust the company more and, if I ever do get back into drinking wine, I'll certainly consider signing up to the Angels scheme again.

NakedWines	GB	Great value and range, excellent customer service	13 December 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Have been an Angel for a couple of years now and have  had a great experience across the board. App and online account are both very easy to navigate, can skip or change cases easily and leave reviews. Direct debit flexibility is brilliant, again very easy to change amount and card. I have signed up to several 'never miss out' cases which I have found really useful- email notifications in advance so if you don't want it, you can skip but rarely do. Also really good to not miss out on the Christmas case, which this year was mostly good and alwyas love the range and quality as well as the free gifts. There were a couple of wines really not to our taste but Callie in the customer service team was superb - refunded the wines and recommended a few others for replacement. One thing that would be good but appreciate that this is a challenge due to shipping and breakages- the wines that we didn't like in the box, we would have liked to replace in the same month and order just a couple- however you have to order a minimum of 6. If there is a way to review this in future, that would be greatly appreciated. Overall, love being a member of Naked Wines and being an Angel!

NakedWines	GB	The best.	07 January 2023	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	"I don't usually leave reviews on Trustpilot but I think that many of the one-star reviews are unjustified. So I'd like to share my 'counter-experience'...Quality slipping - no, due to the business model, NW don't make the wine, they just invest in wine producers who then supply NW direct. My dad always used to say they (the French at least) keep the best stuff for themselves to sell direct, and it's so true! I think some people expect bottles that would cost £40-50 in the supermarkets for a tenner from NW. I thoroughly enjoy all wines I receive, excellent value for money.Delivery - unless you've been living in a cave for the last few months, this one's fairly self-explanatory. The RM strikes have had a knock-on effect on all carriers.Ease of cancellation - it's easy, I found out how to in two minutes. Full refund back to your card. No ""call this number to cancel"" like some subscription services I could mention. Not that I intend to.I love it. Now that I've got the direct debit about right, I look forward to receiving each case and enjoy all the wines I receive. The business model is great, I love how you can speak to individual wine producers. It feels good to know that you're investing in these small-batch vineyards, and that they get a better deal than going to the likes of Tesco, etc.Just logged in and there's an '18 for 12' bottle sale on. Hold my glass..."

Really, some minor issues which I'm sure could be rectified.

This is now the 3rd of January and I'm still waiting on my order being delivered. Have continually raised my concerns which have fallen on deaf ears. I have also requested this be escalated to management, which I've yet still to hear from. Please avoid this company and go elsewhere. No option to give them zero stars which I would have done.

I now have the wine and am happy with the service. I think third-party contractors might be to blame here, specifically the deliver people, which is a shame because the wines really are delicious. -----I'm sure the company has great intentions, but it simply can't keep its promises. Ordered box of 12 bespoke wines worth about £170 first week of December. The box arrived late and four bottles were missing. Emailed customer service and they said they'd send out the missing bottles plus a complementary one. Never happened. Been ghosted ever since.

NakedWines	GB	NO CHRISTMAS WINE DELIVERY	21 December 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Ordered and paid for a Christmas Box up front at the beginning of November it should have left the warehouse mid-November. After chasing on 27th November I was told there were technical difficulties in the warehouse and because of the Black Friday rush there had been delays  - I was assured the order would go out as a priority week beginning 6th December. I chased again yesterday 21st Dec to be told that again there were warehouse problems and that they would not be able to fulfill my order.  Absolutely shocking customer service -  they over promised and could not deliver - my money £182.99 got refunded yesterday. I am utterly fed-up to put it mildly and expected better than this.6th January 2023 - No communication since 21 Dec  from Naked Wines - account closed and request for refund of £80 held in account - a customer lost no more to be said.

NakedWines	GB	Non delivery of Christmas wine and gifts	20 December 2022	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	Sadly my long awaited expensive Christmas case has not arrived. It was supposed to be delivered in November 2022, then 8-15th December. Like many others people. a lot of their very good wine, was intended as Christmas presents for friends and family. And this is probably the first year, I’ve been organised,and prepared ahead of time.Each time I have enquired about the delayed delivery, I have been told it will be delivered and I will be updated, but sadly, I think I’m going to have to ask for a refund, in order to buy alternative Christmas presents.It was a significant purchase, and it is very disappointing, considering it was expected in November.Before this, they were fabulous, good wines, attentive customer service, and kind refunding a payment.I would have given a 5 star review previously, so have tempered my star rating from the one, I was going to give, to a mid way score.

NakedWines	GB	Great and professional service	19 December 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	They offer a great range of bespoke wines, I had a delivery issue were the courier delivered to wrong address, it was dealt with very promptly and professionally. I also had monies left on my account as I had to stop angel pay due to financial reasons, they refunded balance back to me with no problem.I can not thank them all for enough. I highly recommend there services and customer support!!!
NakedWines	GB	Non delivery of paid for hamper	19 December 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Failed to deliver the Christmas Wine hamper due in November. Promised it would be delivered last week, but it wasn't. Requested closure of account and return of hundreds of pounds owed before start of business today. Now not responding to mails. Remember Park hampers? Don't touch with a barge pole. Out of pocket and no wine for Christmas.The customer service team are now refusing to close my account and return owed monies as requested.Simply not good enough.I am now having to take legal advice.Truly shocking.

NakedWines	GB	Christmas case ordered mid November	18 December 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Christmas case ordered mid November, with a delivery due by 8th December. When it didn't arrive I chased to be told it would be with me by 17th December. Today is the 18th and the order still hasn't been dispatched. I had hoped to use the wine over the past 2 weeks for presents and social events, so have ended up spending more money on additional wine from shops. Still no update on my order. Shocking service
NakedWines	GB	christmas offer 18 bottles for 12	16 December 2022	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	as a long term memeber of many years i was dissappointd to find the Xmas 18 bottles for price of 12 offer was sold out within a day.I continued to order a christmas mixed case ,I enquired what the bonus bottle for December was, and was told this ran out 2 days previous, with no offer of an alternative.
NakedWines	GB	Complete bungling of Christmas Order	16 December 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Reserved my Christmas box back in August, where I paid for it over three instalments, ending in October. According to my account, this wine was 'picked' on the 18th of November, yet still has not been handed over to Yodel to courier yet. I queried this a week ago, and I got a slightly tongue-in-cheek reply telling me that their 'little elves' were clearing the backlog and I 'should be stocked up for the festivities in no time' - this should have been by the 16th at the latest.I had arranged a pre-Christmas party last night (16th), for which I had to go out and buy another 6 bottles of wine, so I think I can confidently say that the little elves still have some work to do if the case is to arrive before Christmas.What on earth was the point in reserving something 4 months prior, only to be subject to a complete failure to deliver. Clearly, looking at the most recent reviews concerning the Christmas cases, I'm not the only one being put through the wringer. I've been a customer for over 10 years and have previously recommended them to friends on the basis I had nothing negative to say about them, but they need to know that they got this one badly wrong.
NakedWines	GB	Ordered a Christmas case....	17 December 2022	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	Ordered a Christmas case....still not with the carrier despite being notified it was picked on the 1st December. Had to chase to find out what was going on - first response blamed a warehouse error, second blamed Yodel.....yet Yodel have not yet received it. I understand if there are problems but should be proactive and keep customers updated.
NakedWines	GB	Christmas box delivery	17 December 2022	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	I have used naked wine, on and off for a few years. Always enjoyed the wines and love receiving the box.  But I ordered the Christmas box, knowing it would be here in plenty of time for Christmas, so something less to stress about. I received a email saying there was a delay. Should be with us between 8th- 18th December, it’s still not here (17th). No email. I needed it this week for a party. I’m beginning to wonder if it’s even going to be here for Christmas Day… 🤦🏼‍♀️😢😢😢😢

NakedWines	GB	Better wine for same money	16 December 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I’ve been a member for 4 or so years. A great company ! If you are budget conscious but like nice wine this is a good option. My summary is that you don’t necessarily save money vs buying in the supermarket but you will get better wine for the same money.Ordering via app and delivery always super low fuss too.Credit where it’s due!

NakedWines	GB	Let me know when there was a delay and what they were doing about it.	13 December 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	The delivery didn't arrive due to a problem with the delivery company. The staff at Naked Wines kept me in touch with what was happening via email, and, when it was clear that the delivery was not going to arrive, organised a new delivery including a small gift.Knowing why there was a delay was very helpful.
NakedWines	GB	I tried to cancel after the first order…	15 December 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	"I tried to cancel after the first order of mediocre wine arrived and despite their claim that I can ""cancel at any time"" and there are ""no strings attached,"" I have to call them during their business hours and wait to speak to someone who will no doubt try to keep me from canceling. I can't even remove my credit card information or addresses. I want my account with Naked Wines closed immediately and all my personal data purged from their systems."
NakedWines	GB	Complete utter scam	15 December 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Complete utter scam - they have started debiting money out of my account when I did not agree to a subscription. Completely conned with nhs discount - do not use this sight it’s not a discount.
NakedWines	GB	So dissappointed	15 December 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	"So dissappointed.  I went in all excited, ordered my first two crates, at checkout they offered this angel status, without very clearly explaining that this would be a monthly subscriptions, so first they are sneaky about it. Thn, it is not possible to cancel it online, you have to call them.  What is this, 1995??  Incredibly poor poor experience, and it is such a shame as I was really excited about trying them but this kind of shady business practice means I do not want to do business with them again.  Advice to management: make it ABUNDANTLY clear that angel = monthly subscription.  I am sure you hid it somewhere in the sea of words, but do make it clear.   Stop relying on people accidentally subscribing and then either forgetting to cancel or not bothering to call.  Make it cancellable online.  Seriously, this is so very poor :(Editing to add this to address the response from the company: You fail to acknowledge my biggest beef, which is that in 2022 you do not allow people to cancel online, you are forcing them to cal you, probably in the hope that some people are unable to, or won't bother/forget.  Making cancellations difficult is the#1 business malpractice/shady practice. Also, telling me "" sorry if these emails didnt reach you"" is the height of cynicism.  You never sent any information about angel status PRIOR TO me accidentally joining (which was due to your intransparent and convoluted order acknowledgement page).  Own up to your mistakes and improve, rather than deflect."

NakedWines	GB	My complaint is they do not respond to…	21 November 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	My complaint is they do not respond to emails. I have been a customer for some time now and my last delivery was a disaster, despite requesting our delivery to be left with a neighbour should we be out  ( and the delivery company confirming this would happen) our wine delivery was left outside our house in the rain resulting in the box disintegrating two bottles breaking and absolutely no reply to my email regarding this from this company
NakedWines	GB	Opt out How ?	12 December 2022	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	Cancelled because of the delivery service and the affordability but why have a button on your site where you can in one click opt out of all direct marketting that does not work ?
NakedWines	GB	Poor service - 'free' wine?	11 December 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Poor service. Ordered 2 boxes of Champagne for my sons (cost £300); then a box of Italian red for me (£70-80). I then looked for the 'free' bottle of Malbec as promised. I was then told I needed to order another 6 bottles to qualify for the 'free' bottle. In other words a 'free' bottle will cost me £450+. Misleading, really misleading. I now want to terminate my subscription and can't find out how to do this.
NakedWines	GB	Missing delivery	10 December 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	After my delivery going missing, I emailed the help and Ben at naked wines replaced my order. The customer service was excellent and all was resolved in time for Christmas.
NakedWines	GB	Terrible customer service and delivery	11 December 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Been an angel with this company for a few years now and not really had an issue before but that's no longer the case.Paid for a Christmas box nearly a month ago and have been chasing delivery ever since. Now they have finally said that the Christmas box is being returned to them and do I want to go on a waiting list to possibly get sent another. 2 weeks before Christmas!!!After asking them to now refund my money and close my account they have said they have to wait for the box to be returned to them before issuing a refund. This box has been with Yodel the whole time. Needles to say I'm not very happy with the service and requested they raise a complaint.So far all that's been done is my account cancelled and left me hanging over the £163 I've paid for a Christmas box.Terrible customer service, terrible delivery service.Beware of this company as they use Yodel to deliver or not deliver in this case.

NakedWines	GB	Impossible to cancel subscription	10 December 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Got a promo voucher, which I used, but I’m not interested in any wine subscription. Once I paid over £100 for my wine case, I went to my account settings in order to cancel my subscription. Worth noting that when choosing the case and inserting my address and payment details, the link to their terms and conditions did not work.I managed to find the cancellation page, only to find out that I can’t, I have to ring them up. A shame that customers can subscribe and pay for everything on their website, yet when it comes to cancellations, they require a phone call. Their customer service is open pretty much at the same times as my working hours, so not easy to do if you work full time!Guaranteed, I’ll be waiting on hold for ages before I actually manage to speak to someone who will then, of course, give me a big sale pitch and try to persuade me to stay with them. Do not like these tactics at all! And for that reason alone I wouldn’t recommend signing up with them.

NakedWines	GB	If you love good wine and friendly people, Naked Wines is the place to go	09 December 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I've never had a bad experience with Naked Wines since joining 3-4 years ago. I've also never had issues with deliveries. Customer service is great. The chaps on Twitter are lovely (Porto Pablo here). The wine-tasting sessions (live and online) are fun and informative. The website is great with lots of helpful people. A very happy customer.
NakedWines	GB	Sad to be writing this review…	09 December 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Sad to be writing this review as we have loved Naked Wines since we joined, but we are now thinking about leaving and trying other services. We placed an order for the Christmas box on November 10th with an expected delivery date of November 17th. Several days past the expected delivery date, I sent a note to check on things and received a reply that there was some issues, but to be assured that the case would arrive by November 30. No issues from us on this - we understand that things can happen, just wanted to ensure it hadn't been forgotten. Once December 1st came around with no updates, I sent another note to check in, and was told that due to multiple issues they were having, the wines would now be delivered anywhere from December 8 - December 17. This is because our orders are now behind the Black Friday orders - even though we were meant to receive them a week before Black Friday. Not sure why we were now placed at the back of the list, and no response to that when I asked. So many issues and errors have gone on here, and I am disappointed that Naked Wines have not really taken accountability and offered any recompense whatsoever. We are not fussy folk and were not expecting the whole thing to be comped or anything remotely like that, but last time we had a parcel delayed by 1 DAY and they stuck 25 quid in our Angel account - without us saying a word or asking! So now that it's delayed over a month, on a nearly £200 parcel, that was meant to be for the whole month of December, for which we have now missed having the wine for the multiple events we are having this month, they are just wiping their hands of it. And we are now out additional money purchasing wines for these events. I'm surprised you had the boldness to say the 17th is 'in plenty of time for Christmas!' for 17 bottles and a bottle of gin. We all know people have events all throughout the month, not just Christmas weekend. It is now the 9th and still no updates. We are just really disappointed all around, and not even sure with all these issues if it will end up coming at all. Super disappointed.
NakedWines	GB	Never disappoints	08 December 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Although I am no longer and angel I order from time to time when I get an invite.

NakedWines	GB	Delivery Unavailable	05 December 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I have been a loyal customer for a number of years and have to say I am very disappointed with the level of service recently. I attempted to order my Christmas wine this year with the money in my Angel account only to be told you have suspended deliveries to addresses in my area. I spoke to one of your team who explained (without anything resembling an apology) that this was a temporary measure and things should be resolved in a week or so and to try and place my order next week. Meanwhile, some of the items I wished to purchase have sold out. I’m sorry but this isn’t good enough. I have now purchased my Christmas order elsewhere to ensure it arrived on time and will be closing my account.

NakedWines	GB	Hard to find fault	07 December 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I’ve been a subscriber to Naked for some years now. I have never had a bad experience, never drink a bad wine, never had a delayed delivery. Pretty perfect on all fronts: a caring and classic outfit. Highly recommended.

NakedWines	GB	Poor delivery service.	07 December 2022	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	Naked. You really need to use another courier. You will be aware of how many negative reviews you've received regarding the delivery service. I'm genuinely concerned that the choice of courier is totally undermining your business. Today I had my Christmas wine delivered. The positive I have to report is the delivery date was accurate unlike that of other complainant's. But the big negative is that the driver did not ring my apartment bell and left a £200 box of wine at the front door on full view to the public walking past my door! This is beyond poor. I've left Yodel feedback, but am letting you know about this here too. Your delivery service used to be excellent, and now it's letting you down big time.
NakedWines	GB	Fallen Angel !!	05 December 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	"Continued failures by your courier to deliver within designated time scale. No response from "" Delivery Guy "" to my email regarding two failed deliveries. The only time your courier managed to deliver was via Click and Collect which isn't currently being operated. Have now cancelled account / subscription and this order. Seriously disappointed and disgruntled customer. I'm a £100+ out of pocket - who knows where the case is - and who knows when my account will be credited. Will never deal with Naked again and have moved to a wine club with its own dedicated courier service guaranteeing next day delivery.  A great shame your delivery doesn't match your products which are excellent."

Unfortunately, I was due to be on holiday during the proposed delivery dates.  I got in touch with Naked Wines who explained how I could delay the delivery until my return.The order arrived promptly on my new chosen delivery date.  Lovely wines, gifts and spirits, well packed which ensured everything arrived in one piece.  It’s great being an Angel so you can save up to get exactly what you like.  Recommended company

The website, and now app, are easy to navigate and provide a good intuitive interface for the purchasing experience. But what makes Naked really exemplary is the people there - any time I have had to call them for any reason, the person on the other end of the line is always as pleasant and helpful as they can possibly be. It never feels like you're having to work to get help, but that whoever you get is genuinely keen on making sure you leave the call happy. This is customer service that truly excels.

I now find that it hasn’t even been shipped to the courier. However I can expect to receive it between 8th and 17th December. Used to have excellent deliveries and service but now failing terribly
NakedWines	GB	Maybe not just the courier!	13 November 2022	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	I agree with Naked Wines choice of carrier, I, like many have had numerous issues with Yodel in the past. However, the wine I ordered over 2 weeks ago hasn’t even left Naked Wines yet! An email from Naked 2 weeks ago gave an estimated delivery date of 17/11. Both Naked and Yodel’s tracking state that it is still with Naked. No updates since. This is the second time I have signed up with Naked, stupidly gave them a second chance which it doesn’t seem they deserve. Patience is running very thin! 2 stars for now, happy to amend up or down depending on response from customer service in the next 24-48 hours.
NakedWines	GB	Need to use a better courier.	25 November 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	As a number of other reviewers have said, I have no issue with Naked Wines or their products, only with their appalling choice of delivery company, namely Yodel. This company has failed to follow delivery instructions, not delivered when they said they would, and lied about where my wine was delivered. After fruitlessly trying to chase up my order with both Naked Wines and Yodel, I was contacted by a member of the public who found my package left in a random location half a mile from the place Yodel claim to have delivered it. This is beyond incompetence, and borders on criminal negligence.In future I will buy my wine from Waitrose, I have better things to do with my life than chase up Yodel's mistakes.

NakedWines	GB	Naked wines as a company is a great…	26 November 2022	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	Naked wines as a company is a great idea, pay a monthly subscription, which they invest in small vineyards to help winemakers produce lovely wine. Perfect concept, until you introduce the delivery firm; Yodel into the mix. I only order a couple of times a year and on my last 3 deliveries Yodel have ensured I spend days trying to track my delivery and emailing the company (can’t contact Yodel). Well I finally give up, after nearly a decade of supporting this lovely idea for a company; Yodel have succeeded in crushing my optimism and my investment. I will be leaving and simply buying my wine from my local wine merchant instead.
NakedWines	GB	It’s an absolutely fabulous company!	26 November 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	It’s a fabulous company, the wines are wonderful and there is an amazing choice of delicious bottles of every possible variety and colour, just waiting to be savoured.

NakedWines	GB	Great wines and excellent customer service.	24 November 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	We have been Angels for a number of years and can’t fault the company.  The wines are really good  and there’s an excellent selection at a wide range of prices.  We feel we are helping new winemakers and the customer service has always been excellent.  We have only had a problem with one wine and when it was pointed out we were refunded for all three bottles and also given a free bottle of our choice, to compensate: there had been a problem with the bottling and we were not the only customers to complain, so it was not the fault of Naked themselves and the problem was well handled.  We  also greatly enjoyed the two tasting events we went to in those heady days before Covid.  My only criticism is with Yodel who, if they do deliver when they say they will, often just  dump the box inside the gate, in clear view of the street and then just drive off without taking the time to even ring the doorbell. If you track the progress and see how many deliveries these drivers are expected to make it’s hardly surprising that there are massive delays.  Maybe time for Naked to search for another delivery company?

These guys really go above a beyond for their customers. We had a number of issues with Yodel the delivery company in the delivery of our first box in particular, while that was frustrating the team at Naked wines followed up and we received regular updates and communication, I felt really valued as a customer.The wines themselves are really nice with a great selection, and I think for the quality are pretty reasonably priced. It also feels good to support independent wine makers. We look forward to trying more wines in the future. Thank you naked wines! Keep up the good work
NakedWines	GB	Naked Wines use disgraceful Yodel	18 November 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Naked Wines use Yodel who are without doubt the most appalling partner.  Waited in all day yesterday to be informed they tried to deliver and left card saying sorry we missed you, all of which are lies.  At 07:35 they were going to deliver today.  Received a msg at 10:47 saying sorry couldn’t deliver to you today, wonderful! can’t wait to know why. Naked Wines change provider Yodel will destroy your brand
NakedWines	GB	Really disappointed	17 November 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Really disappointed.  Have been an Angel for several years but have now cancelled.  Order due yesterday but appears to be still at Yodel’s national hub.  No update on expected delivery.  Emailed Naked but may have to wait 72 hours for response.  £110 out of pocket.
NakedWines	GB	Probably the best customer service of…	17 November 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Probably the best customer service of any company I have dealt with. They have got things right time and time again. Oh, and the wines great as well.
NakedWines	GB	I have recently had reason to…	11 November 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I have recently had reason to communicate with customer service over an issue and I was pleasantly surprised, the service I received was over and above what I’ve come to expect from most companies I’ve had to deal with recently. I’m not a member, my husband was, I’ve never heard him complain about the service or quality of the product and if I were considering membership of a wine supplier Naked Wines would definitely be my choice
NakedWines	GB	Dysfunctional. Waste of time.	11 November 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	"Dysfunctional.Registered account on 6th November on basis of a voucher offered to me by an affiliate company to NW. I was offered a next day (7th November) delivery of the 18 bottles I bought. I selected the date and worked from home on 7/11 to take delivery. No delivery. No communication until 10/11 where I receive a text saying: Welcome to NW please have a look at his YouTube video of a wine producer.  No information of my delivery.  Tried to log on to my account several times but was told by the NW ""system"" that either my email address or my password was wrong.  Used the useless NW ""chat bot"" and found the phone number.  Got in touch with a nice lady (Donna) who could see that the NW delivery team had chased Yodel a couple of times for delivery....I didn't even know that NW is using Yodel and I really don't care who they use. I didn't receive my wine. But more importantly, what I found out from a later email from Donna, was that my registered email account had been changed by the dysfunctional NW ""system"" which had added a 2-digit to my email address as I seemingly had registered with NW years ago.  However, I wasn't advised by the ""system"" that my account had already been registered - and so NW happily communicated with an email address that doesn't exist.When Donna (friendly and nice!) made it clear to me that ""the error isn't with us but with Yodel"" - I had to let her know that I fundamentally do not care about who they use for shipment, but that I very much care that they understand how to live up to their promises of delivery.  At this point, I had lost my faith in NW as a ""club"" membership that I otherwise liked when reading about it.  I simply don't want to waste my time with club memberships that are happy to take my money but cannot comply with simple, low practical communication and account management.  So I asked her for a cancellation of my membership. I am now awaiting a refund of my money.Shame. I like the idea of supporting small independent winemakers and were otherwise happy to pay the £25 monthly fee.  But I am time poor and cannot afford the time wasting and having to speak to customer service every time I am expecting a delivery.  Back to procuring my wine my own way!NW - your concept is great. But your operations is not."
NakedWines	GB	Great service	11 November 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Great service, great website and full of information making the choice easier
NakedWines	GB	Incorrect delivery address	10 November 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Over the past few years wine has been sent to the wrong address. Luckily I know who the recipient is, it's my next door neighbour. They have tried to have this problem resolved as have myself to no avail. A delivery was made to my address 10th.November 2022.. Told courier that the package was not for me, he ignored me and drove off. No doubt my neighbour will be in contact.Thank you for your reply today 11th. The problem is that the label states the correct recipient but the wrong house number.
NakedWines	GB	Diabolical	10 November 2022	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	"Naked Wines use Yodel to ""deliver"". On my first subscription with them ""Yodel"" claimed nobody was here to deliver, aside from the fact I was in all day tracking the van, delivery instructions were to leave with neighbour if not here. The excuse then changed to ""couldn't find property"", our village is one road, you can't go wrong. The excuse then changed to ""wine damaged in transit"". Naked Wines reordered, next delivery I wasnt here, the Yodel driver handed a clear labelled Naked Wines box of 6 bottles to my 14yo daughter who had just arrived home from school and was still in here uniform! I cancelled my order.Two years on thought Id give them another chance. Ordered to be delivered from a local collection point. Two days after due date, NW emailed to say wine was at a Yodel collection depot 30 miles from booked collection point, Yodel couldn't then rearrange delivery to my home as it was at their collection not deliver depot at the same site.Yet again I have cancelled my subscription. Definitely will not be giving a third chance.Disappointed, dissatisfied, diabolical service."

NakedWines	GB	Naked Wines	03 November 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Naked Wines; a place where you can pirchase cheap homemade plonk dressed up up in fancy bottles dressed in ‘professional’ labels. Truth is, it’s chemical wine kits, home brewed, head-ache hangover dog-sh*** dressed up in lovely expensive looking packaging. Avoid them at all costs and stick to the trusted brands unless you wish to experience 4 - day hangovers. Their wines are mainly homemade chemical crap.

NakedWines	US	This is a wonderful company	02 November 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	This is a wonderful company! The wines are very high quality and they have a wide variety. If you make monthly contributions to your wine account, they put it in a savings account so you can take it back out if you ever change your mind! They were so helpful everytime I’ve ever had a question.
NakedWines	GB	Top quality wines and a supportive business model	22 September 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Top quality wines and a business model that supports winemakers while also giving customers a good deal. I like not being locked in to recurring orders and being able to make my own selections if I want to. Most of the winemakers are also really engaged with subscribers. They are also doing their bit to minimise the environmental impacts all along the supply chain. But most of all, I like the wines.
NakedWines	GB	Subscription scam	30 October 2022	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	Subscription scam.1) I have never intentionally subscribed to Naked Wines, however after 1 purchase, I'm automatically part of the angel club, money got deducted automatically.2) Checkout experience is bad: tell your product manager / tech guy that there is a bug with calculations (I have screenshots). there can be no bugs at checkout experience, it's borderline crime.

NakedWines	GB	"Obviously an ""angels"" only site."	24 October 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	"Like many people I suspect, you receive an offer to save £75 on your first order with Naked Wines, so I thought, I'll give this a try.

NakedWines	GB	Naked - a Wine Company that can be relied upon.	22 October 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	In the years we have enjoyed Naked WInes we have only not liked three bottles ... great going guys! The wine suggestions based on preferences that we upload have always been good and once you follow certain winemakers whose products meets your palate it's a no brainer! No more gazing at aisles of random labels!The web ordering is easy and the website is informative. Delivery is usually good and their carriers seem to have got over a few post-covid glitches.Paying a monthly amount is a good way to make you think about spending too - we've recently taken up their offer to spread the cost of the Christmas Wine Box over four months - helpful and sensible.Lastly if there are any glitches their customer service is good by email and phone.
NakedWines	GB	How to develop your wine tastes	09 September 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	We’ve been members (angels) for I think, a decade. (Oh heck). I like to think our tastes were sophisticated but narrow. We were members of several suppliers but gave Naked a chance as they have a no risk policy. Great decision. Probably the best thing is the variety of styles and countries and the raft of artisan winemakers they’ve uncovered. Delivery is prompt and free at over a typical order value and, should you ever need to speak to a team member (rare), you discover that they wrote the book on customer service.

NakedWines	GB	Naked Wines, a wine club with a difference!	20 October 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	"We were introduced to Naked Wines by our daughter and have been more than impressed by them. It is such a wonderful scheme where each month we pay in, and when we want to purchase anything we might need to top up the payment, or just use what we have in our account. There is no pressure selling and obligation to buy so many bottles a month/quarter/year, and the knowledge of the staff is phenomenal. The products are world class and the support they give to the smaller vineyards is brilliant. If you are looking to join a ""wine club"", Naked Wines is the only one to join."

NakedWines	GB	Wonderful! Love Naked Wines!	09 October 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Wonderful! I love Naked Wines! The app, service and of course the wines are great! And on the one occasion a wine wasnt to my my taste they refunded no problem, just as promised. The quality of the wines has been superb and they’ve been really helpful in helping me find new wines to enjoy. I’d kinda gone off white wines but when I emailed them asking for suggestions and telling them what I knew I didn’t like about white wines the suggested a wonderful selection, all of which were lovely and some stupendous which got me reordering. The facility to reserve a case of your favourite wine when it comes in next season is great too. Once I find something I like I like to have it there so I don’t have to think and know that I’m going to love it each time I open a bottle. The quality overall is just so good. You know you’re drinking a good wine and I’d never find my way to drinking such wines in a supermarket…too much choice and it’s confusing. But doing it the Naked Wines way I can learn what I like and find similar wines that will suit me. Plus having real person reviews adds to the confidence in choosing a new wine. The flexibility around one’s subscription is great too and the way its set up so that the funds are yours until you spend them on wine really appealed to me as it took pressure off and gave me security. Plus, when ones on a bit of a budget, ordering in 6’s or 12’s is actually better, I find i choose better wines because I’m not looking at individual bottle price so much, rather at how the wine fits my tastes. And I know that I have the funds there for the order. Thoroughly recommend giving Naked a go!

The customer service is amazing and the wines are pretty delicious too! The big sell for me was that you save into your angels account and pay up front for wines (you choose what and when!) With that money going towards funding small vineyards a over the world enabling them to compete against the 'big boys'. Regular updates makes it feel like you are  part of an amazing family.

They offer both budget wines and something for a more discerning palette. They build a profile of what you actually like and when you choose a few they have the option to finish your basket which is always resultant in them surprising you with a nice new wine that you love!! Can’t recommend highly enough!! I’m an angel which means I have a direct debit set up so I can save for a nice basket of wine every few months. When you do this they usually pop an extra bottle in for free so you can try it. They offer a money back guarantee too if you don’t like a wine!! Xx

They are certainly not the most expensive or the cheapest, what they do offer is a wide range of affordable good quality wines with excellent delivery on a regular basis. The best thing to me and my wife is we don’t have to stand in the supermarket for 20 plus minutes exploring the same old bottles available at every outlet, trying to remember what we had and liked from last time . Naked take all the hassle and decisions for us and would buy any recommendations from them to have in our house for ourselves and friends to consume without any hesitation. And by subscribing monthly is a huge advantage.

But also that the ethos of the company is very good and the way they use our money to help small wine makers develop and try new things which they couldn't do without upfront funding.  For me I love that I pay a monthly DD into the fund and then when I want to buy some wine the money is sat there waiting for me.  What's not to like?

A good opportunity to sample wines that i wouldnt normally go for from the supermarket shelf, as i know that i wont get a poor one. The website is easy to negotiate with your favourites and earlier orders, recorded for quick selecting.  The small amount of money i put in each month isnt missed and does good for the struggling wine maker. Also very nice when this is deducted from my next order.Communication is always friendly and personal and the webinars allow you to meet the growers in their homes, all around the wine growing world.

NakedWines	GB	One star delivery of 5 star wines - over and out	04 October 2022	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	The wines are great, the ethos is great, the level of customer service from Naked Wines is great.  However, I’ve been moved to cancel my Angel subscription and move to other options until this company move on from Yodel. Your business model is a premium subscription delivery service, yet your delivery partner is shocking.  Get a partner that can deliver on the specified date, that communicates effectively with your customers, that has the good grace to apologise for a delivery on the wrong day.  At least tell us that you are going to let us down early rather than silence… raise the game.  Until then, I am out.  It was fun while it lasted and was great in lockdown where I had no other place to be but at home.  It fell apart after that.

NakedWines	GB	Naked wines, the naked truth.	05 October 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	"I've belonged to several wine clubs over the years but Naked Wines win hands down. The wines on offer are superb and keenly priced. I'm not pressured to take cases of someone else's choice at intervals dictated by the club and customer services are fantastic. Taking the time to review some of the wines elevates you to ""Angel"" status which discounts the wine further. I heartily recommend Naked Wines to anyone who cares more about the taste and quality of the wines they drink than about showing off the ""right"" label."

NakedWines	GB	Great quality and service	23 September 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I’ve been with Naked Wines for over a year. I usually buy a mixed case of red and white. I’ve never had a bad bottle and I love trying wine you don’t find in the supermarket. With my last case, I was given a free bottle which was a lovely touch. Delivery is always reliable, convenient and the communication is great. The emails always feel personal, friendly and informative.

After several other wine clubs thought a change would be good. Looking for quality first but good value too. Have found both. Now have a list of favourites and even though vintages will change every year I’m confident that these producers are offering high quality wines. Also the free bottles that come up from time to time are much appreciated. We’ll pleased. Thank you Naked Wines.

Low and behold I am now a non pink wine drinker and a happy one. Dipping love it.
NakedWines	GB	Caught hook, line and sinker	01 February 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I resisted the Naked wines promotions for many years. Then they sent me an offer that was silly to resist, so I bought 6 bottles, thinking I'd subsequently cancel my subscription. The first bottle I tried was a Merlot, not normally my favourite grape. I knew from the first sip they'd caught me! Needless to say, I didn't cancel and have enjoyed quite a few more bottles since.

I particularly like the way Naked Wines support wine producers throughout the world who are passionate about the wines they make, but who otherwise may not necessarily have the financial backing to help them grow and suceed in such a competitive market. Though finances are tight at present, whenever I can, I will continue to purchase and enjoy the many different wines available. Wishing Naked Wines and the many growers of such fine grapes all the very best."

NakedWines	GB	I love this company!	05 October 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I have been a customer of Naked Wines for over a year now and I love the fact that I can order a box of wine when it suits me, rather than have a box sent every month or 3 months like some other companies do. I save money each month in my account with them and then spend it when I chose either when it has added up enough or I can pay any difference when I order.The wine growers interact with us customers via the App which is lovely and its great to know that we are helping them by buying directly from them. It's also fab to have a new and wide range of different wines to choose from rather than just picking up the same bottles from the supermarket shelves.I highly recommend Naked Wines.

It's good to have the monthly payments and the opportunity to reserve wine that's coming soon - this latest delivery was just that.  There's also the wonderful olive oil and occasional other food or drink-based offers.  And Christmas!  Already looking forward to my Christmas case.But it's not just that.  I love that we can interact as much or as little as we like with the winemakers and also to support a good cause like Carmen Stevens's kitchen.  There's no pressure, but I feel like part of a community that appreciates good wine but also cares about where it comes from and how it gets to my glass.

NakedWines	GB	My Naked Wines experience so far	05 October 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Have subscribed to Naked Wines for a little over 4 months. During this period I have sampled around 14 bottles. I would rate the wines as good to excellent. Compared to supermarket wines at a similar price I would say the wines from Naked are generally superior. As a Naked Wine Angel you get to rate the wines yourself and can view other Angels ratings. If you like sampling different wines I would recommend giving Naked a try.

A regular supply of wine is effortless, you don't get harassed to buy more (unless you want to) and if there is anything you don't like, they pull out all the stops to fix whatever went wrong - I don't buy wine from anywhere else these days!
NakedWines	GB	Best Wine Club Ever!	05 October 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	It’s great to choose well priced wines from smaller wineries, individuals working hard to produce quality wines who, without Naked Wines, would struggle to reach the market. We’ve never had a wine we didn’t like, although you can return one if that happened. We’ve had some great deals - we all love a freebie. It’s £25 a month direct debit but you have a delivery when you want, not at any set day/week/month - and if you have money in the pot and want to stop buying, you can. All our purchases are online for us to see so we always know what are our favourites (most of the 90 odd different ones we’ve had so far!)

These aren’t wines you’ll find elsewhere and it’s the individuality and attention to detail that makes the wines special. In addition you can get to know the winemakers and really understand the wines that they make. I’ve had loads of wine club memberships but Naked knocks spots off all of the others.

Also mounts rescue operations for growers in trouble.   Unfortunately I think that their early incredible success went to their heads and they are trying to expand too fast into more generic wines.   I think that they need to go back to their roots if they are to survive in what is a very competitive market place.

NakedWines	GB	Brilliant	19 September 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I have trusted the staff since I first joined as I was quite new to wine drinking and didn’t know where to begin. They have always got it right. I haven’t had a bottle of wine that I haven’t enjoyed since. I now know what I like and have the confidence to select a wine when in a restaurant and get it right. I have ordered wines in the past that have been awful and wasted my money. Naked wines have a first class service. Thank you Naked Wines.
NakedWines	GB	Hi all	05 October 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Hi all, I am new to this wine club and I am no expert on wine at all, all I know about wine is if I like the taste then it's okay with me. In saying that I have not had one bottle of wine that has caused me to complain about / send back or ask for a refund. So all in all I have had a very good experience with all the wines from Naked Wines that I have had the pleasure of drinking. They are also very good at keeping you informed and up to date with new wine releases and news from their suppliers.

Hardly notice the £20 that goes out each month and every 4 a 5 months I get to spend it on wine of my choice. Not the biggest selection, but generally very good wines at a decent price, average of about £10 to £11 per bottle. Usually something new that takes my fancy each time as well as some tries and tested. Like how they work with small independent wineries that you otherwise wouldn’t be able to come across. A few too many promo emails for my liking but you don’t have to read them if you dont want to.

Customer services are top notch and will sort out any issues quickly. If you don't like a wine then they will refund you the bottle with no questions asked, but it's rare to find a wine you won't like! Their Christmas box is always amazing and great value as is the quality of all the wines available, much superior to supermarket wine. I like that I can save a monthly amount and use it when I've saved enough for the next order I want to place and Naked don't take a penny of the money saved into the account, if you want it back then they will send it back. Honestly a very good company

NakedWines	GB	I always bought lots wine, but...	01 October 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I always bought lots wine even before joining this service. I've been delighted by the access to high quality wines that the Naked system provides. Service is consistently excellent. Any issues always communicated as if your order is being handled by a real person who cares. Also, the company is quite innovative and regularly introduces new ideas, novel wines, which makes me actually want to read their marketing.

NakedWines	GB	Always a fantastic service	15 September 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Always a fantastic service. Have been a member nearly 2 years.

NakedWines	ES	Love Naked Wines	05 October 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I joined naked wines even though I am lucky enough to spend most of my time in Spain. I learn about all of the wines and feel good about supporting all the different projects and winerys. When I return to the UK I have enough in my balance and enough information to enjoy great wines at great prices even though I am used to enjoying Spanish wines normally also at great prices due to duty differences. I treat myself when I get back to the UK and expand my knowledge.

NakedWines	FR	Why I like naked wines	05 October 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I like naked wines. They keep you fully up-to-date with what is happening. Their suppliers are some of the best, if not the best wine producers so the quality is always good no matter what the price.
NakedWines	GB	Excellent company	05 October 2022	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	Excellent company. Fast service. Reasonable prices. Win very good as well.
NakedWines	GB	Very pleased new investor	05 October 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I am relatively new to Naked Wines, but my experience so far has been terrific.  True, the wine is not the cheapest, but the quality is superb and beats any thing I would buy in the supermarket.  I enjoy knowing that my subscription goes towards helping the wine producers and I am currently enjoying Jamie and Stephen de Wet's Reserve 'arabella', a wonderful blend of Shiraz-Petit Verdot.  I get plenty of Naked Wines offers into my InBox, but there is no pressure to buy and I particularly like that.  I can't wait for my next delivery.

NakedWines	GB	Exceptional wines at great prices	05 October 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	The wines are always of exceptional quality, not a bad one yet and well worth every penny. Once you start your monthly savings you forget the amount and before you know it there is enough for one of their top quality cases. Would highly recommend to any wine lover.

NakedWines	GB	This is how I afford decent wine.	05 October 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I've been a member for several years and it's been good. Decent red wine is a staple of my health regime, well I hope, and Naked helps me buy just enough good quality stuff to keep going, affordably. I'm not an enthusiast or buff, I just enjoy wine; I buy at the affordable end of the list but that means I drink good reds I couldn't justify otherwise. And as a gift I get a monthly free bottle of something lovely that's generally worth well over £20.

NakedWines	GB	Become a Naked Wines angel 😇	05 October 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I've been a Naked Wines 'angel' for almost 2 years now and I cannot see me ever returning to supermarkets as a source for wine. I like and endorse the whole ethos of Naked Wines from supporting and investing in small upcoming independent winemakers, the ease of ordering from their App and discovering wines that one will never find from other outlets including supermarkets. Their monthly 'wine genie' is an ideal way to appreciate new varieties based on personal palates and with a 13th bottle enclosed for sampling. Added to that an ability to review wines with a direct link to the individual winemaker wherever they produce in the world and the opportunity to meet in person at Naked wine tastings. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Naked Wines as I have done already many times. Come and join the family! 🍷

The choice of wines is tremendous and you really feel you are supporting individual growers. I also like the fact you are under no obligation to have a case of wine every month, like some suppliers do. The fact you pay a certain amount per month, therefore building up the amount you have to spend, really appeals. Really delicious wines as well!!😀

I've found them a joy to deal with - the wines are invariably excellent with a very wide selection, prices are always good, website easy to operate, deliveries prompt (and on the very rare occasion they're delayed, communications are brilliant too). Especially enjoy their (new-ish, small but growing) range of boxed wines, and of course the special Christmas treat boxes. Would recommend to anyone.

NakedWines	GB	I love Naked Wines	05 October 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I love Naked Wines! Why? For lots of reasons. First of all, you can choose exactly how much you want to spend, and their system helps you to budget for your wine purchases. They have some great offers too, so you know your really getting your money's worth. Secondly, I'm not a wine expert, but I like good wines. Naked Wines help you choose, with information about each bottle and a rating to tell you what have been the best loved wines by their members. There's also a really useful personal record of which wines you've bought, where you also give them a personal rating and add notes to remind you what you liked (or didn't like about them).You get to know some really unusual wines, from some of the smaller, but excellent vineyards, and you also know that you're helping support them with your purchases.You also get personal messages from wine producers thanking you for your ratings.As well as all this, you get special offers, a chance to muscle in on an eagerly-awaited wine as soon as it arrives, special tasting events to learn more about wines and the chance to put together your own selection of wines each time you make a purchase if you prefer a personalised crate.It's flexible, friendly and fabulous!!

NakedWines	FR	Be an angel	30 September 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Just received my case of reds with an additional three free bottles. The selection is really good and reasonably priced. I like the idea of helping winegrowers and bottlers to increase their trade through the help of an organisation that is set up to do just that. It's also useful to pay a small amount a month towards the next selection and to know that the next case will be just as good.

NakedWines	GB	The Best Wine Club Ever	05 October 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Naked Wines is one of the best things I've joined, I set aside a certain amount of money each month, and I'm not forced or pushed into buying a set amount of wines each month. The premise is that there are lists of bottles of wines listed with the Winemaker, and you choose which wines you want to buy. You can buy as little or as many as you want. When you've chosen what you want, then you can pay for them and they're there, normally within 2 days. If you don't have enough money, you can either top up or you can continue saving every month until you have the amount of money in your savings to buy the wine you wine.
NakedWines	GB	Quality wines from Naked Wine	05 October 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Naked Wines are extremely reliable.The quality of all of the wines which I have tried is very consistent and I never get any hassle from them if I don't order each month.
NakedWines	GB	Why Naked Wine	05 October 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	For me naked has substantially broadened my experience with wine, their selection introduces you to a whole new world of lands and their vineyards far and wide, for me anyway, this adds a new dimension which enriches the contents of the glass with an imaginary visual dream which helps escape the problems of today, I do not get this sort of personal involvement with any other provider, this makes Naked my go to supplier, and you genuinely get excited waiting for the ever so prompt delivery van.

She has enjoyed every variety she has tried saying they are far superior to what is available in the supermarkets. To know we are helping small independent businesses rather than the retail giants gives you the feel good factor.

NakedWines	GB	Customer Satisfaction	05 August 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I have been a member of Naked Wines since June 2021 and have enjoyed all of the wines purchased from them.  The wine growers contribute on the website from time to time, to explain the wines and the regions that they come from.  An easy app to use to order, scan bottles to find out more about a particular wine and save favourites.   Wines are all delivered within a few days of order.
NakedWines	GB	Give it a go!	05 October 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Since joining the company we have had the pleasure of experiencing new wines that we would never have tried, indeed, never seen on supermarket shelves.  We feedback if we like it, if we don’t, why we do/don’t, and they use this feedback to suggest different wines for us to try.It’s worth paying that extra £1 or 2 a bottle for a taste experience.  We have never been pressured into buying anything, they even offer to refund you if you don’t like any of the bottles you try, but we have never asked for a refund as we believe if one doesn’t agree with our taste buds, someone else is raving about it!!!If you like wine I would highly recommend giving it a go.
NakedWines	GB	Naked Wines- Just What It Says On The Tin (Bottle)	05 August 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Since I joined Naked Wines they have done everything they have promised. Accounting seems efficient, deliveries are on time . We have enjoyed our selections based on their recommendations.

NakedWines	GB	Top Notch wines, and great service	05 October 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I’ve been an ‘Angel’ for a few years now, and can honestly say I’ve never had a bad experience trying out new wines. Some wines have been ok, some good, some very good, and quite a few were absolutely great. I can only remember not liking one or maybe two, and in that case(s) I told Naked, and they refunded my money without quibble.
NakedWines	GB	Amazing Wine	05 October 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I've had nothing but a great experience from Naked Wines.

I got 14 bottles of wine, 2 bottles of port, a bottle of Gin and then some wine glasses and a couple of treats like virgin olive oil, excellent value for money.

The Naked wines never fail to impress even when they’re not my sort of thing. I can open any of them with confidence of top quality.Add to that the social programmes that are supported through Naked and it gets my vote every time. Just try it.

NakedWines	GB	Well worth a glug!	05 October 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I have been receiving deliveries from Naked Wines for approximately 2yrs. I initially signed up for the introductory offer but found I loved the selection of wine on offer. The website is easy to navigate and delivery is excellent. Having the hard work done for me saves loads of time at the supermarket and ensures I try a range of wines rather than plod on with the one or two wines I'm familiar with. There is no pressure to buy; I probably have a case once every 2/3 months. For people well into their wines you can take part in wine tastings and get to know about the winemakers/regions. Personally, I just like the wine!

Input from the winemakers themselves makes you feel that the whole experience is also worthwhile as you are helping them make more great wines.Any issues are resolved quickly and politely and you can move on to the next bottle.
NakedWines	GB	I joined Naked just over a year ago…	05 October 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I joined Naked just over a year ago after becoming a bit disappointed with a previous high profile wine club. The idea of paying a monthly variable fee suited as well. I have found the standard of wines to be really good. These range generally from £8 for mid week wines upto £15 for special treat wines. I enjoy reading about the wine makers and you seem to get to know them and find out your favourites.

I'm not a big drinker I just wanted to use the voucher but what a palaver. You have to sign up as an Angel and give them your credit card details. I just want to spend the voucher but won't bother now which is a shame. Impossible to find out how to cancel your account on their website - it's quite complicated.
NakedWines	GB	Overpriced by 60-70%	29 September 2022	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	"I've ordered a wine because got 64% discount. Otherwise won't bother.Many ""exclusive"" cheaper wines are sold 3 times price what you would pay for the same bottle in Portugal, Spain, France.It might be different vineyard and bodega nut decent quality.As example I researched 4 wines what on Naked wines are sold between £10-£12 per a bottle. A month ago they were £2.70 up to £3.10 in France and Spain.Just saying, avoid scam. Generally UK wine market is a dead trash with juge stich up. No need to contact me please. Just have some more respect for makers and buyers. Don't full people with subscription service or out of touch price for cheap wine.Thank You for replying. Cheap wine is not necessary bad. I'm aware what UK government is taking £6.00  in ""taxes"" from £10.50 bottle. Add transport and storage. You could run different business model and it would half price per bottle. But £1.50 per litre wine sold as ""quality"".... For £10.50... well. I wondering if people know how wine should taste."

NakedWines	GB	Delivery is TERRIBLE, Wine is EXCELLENT	27 September 2022	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	"I have been a ""Naked Angel"" for many years and have really enjoyed the vast majority of the bottles of wine they have sent me. BUT I have just cancelled my subscription because the delivery service that they offer is just too unreliable. I have had many issues (multiple delays, deliveries to the wrong house, couriers refusing to admit their mistakes etc) and it's now got to the point where this outweighs the fact that the wine is excellent. So this 3 star review is actually 1-star for delivery and 5-star for the wine. Reading through the other reviews, it is clear that my experiences are shared with many others... it is SO sad that an excellent wine merchant is letting its attempts to get ""cut price"" delivery put its whole business at risk."

NakedWines	GB	Everything about Naked Wines is great	16 September 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Everything about Naked Wines is great. No pressure to buy on a regular basis unless by pre arrangement, for wines you particularly love, when a new vintage arrives even then they check before they send. The ability to save on a monthly basis. Also you can try new or different wines safe in the knowledge that if they are not to your taste you can return for a full refund. What is not to love.
NakedWines	US	Terrible shipping	27 September 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Wines are fine, however, when you make an order you have no idea when it will arrive. The delivery is made with UPS and someone has to be home to sign it. They will not allow you to pick up the package at their facility. So just cross your fingers that you are home when they deliver and that ups doesn’t “forget the package at the facility” on a day you are off.

NakedWines	GB	Always happy with the wine... but!	23 September 2022	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	Always happy with the wine, but they invariably get something wrong with the order. This time I'm not going to get it on the day they said, I don't yet know when it will be delivered. Last time instead of 12 bottles of red, they sent a case of 6 mixed, also delayed. On complaining they promised to send a further 6 bottles of better reds and told me what they would be. They didn't, the wine they sent was a mix of the standard wine and some upgraded. Great at wine, not great at business and logistics.
NakedWines	GB	Excellent customer service	22 September 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Damian from their office on Norwich called me to recommend some wines. I’m not normally the type of person that would take an unsolicited call but glad I did. He was extremely knowledgeable had done his research and an absolute credit to NW. Please promote him / give him a raise as his passion, customer service and his whole demeanour could be used elsewhere in the organisation. Fantastic experience.

NakedWines	GB	Good wines, great concept, but awful delivery	19 September 2022	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	"I've been with Naked wines a few years now.The wine offer is pretty good and I like the idea that being an ""Angel"" you can help indipendent wine makers, that's great.However they keep using Yodel, the worst courier on Earth, which in all these years only managhed to make a single delivery drama free, all the other ones were always delayed with different excuses:- Once they couldn't find my address (guess what, it doesn't move!)- Once there were road closures (no there weren't)- Multiple times they didn't even bother to explain, they just delayed the delivery.Very good wines, but the delivery experience is extremely frustrating at the point that I am seriuosly thinking of canceling my subscription at the next delivery drama from Yodel.@NakedWines: please, do move away from Yodel, they're ruining your image!"
NakedWines	GB	Keep away and avoid being fleeced	19 September 2022	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	It is not clear at all that this is a very expensive subscription service - it is costing some £25 a month. I immediately canceled once they took £25 from my bank. The first order I got was OK and then one of the wines I liked I looked up and was surprised just how expensive it was. But it was of course out of stock - the web site is poor because it makes no suggestions of alternatives - better to go to Tesco in term of value.

I ordered the Naked Test Drive Red Case. There is a delivery fee of £4.99.  The box of 12 got delivered after 2 days. I am impressed by the service. Moreso, the quality of the red wines appears to be premium from different winemakers (Italy, Chile, Australia, South Africa, Argentina, France ... the usual suspects). The first 2 bottles I opened impressed my guests. I can't wait to try the rest. They also included some Reserve Wine in the box which I am so happy about.

I like wines that are good alone; or with a little snack with friends or a nice full bodied wine for a fabulous dinner. Either way, ""In Wine There Is Truth"" and I am particular about who I ""Break Bread"" with and the wine I serve. Cheers!"
NakedWines	GB	Once an Angel always an Angel	14 September 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Been an Angel with naked wines for a few years now and love the flexibility of adjusting monthly payments. We usually build up our account and then treat ourselves to a mixed case we pick ourselves it feels like we are getting our wine free as you don't miss a small amount going out every month. My Sister is now an Angel too, as she has sampled ours on many an occasion.

You only can use it for one box of wine and you can’t choose yours. Why do you tease people like that and then make people upset?
NakedWines	GB	Great way to experience new wines	26 March 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	This a great way to experience new wines for a reasonable price, whilst supporting smaller producers.I’ve only had good experiences with this company to date and have happily recommended them to friends. My monthly payment (£25) allows me to save cash in my wallet and then place an order when I get to the £100 or so mark. Reviews that mention the £25 as being a surprise can only be from people who didn’t pay attention when they signed up. It’s really obvious that this is a subscription model - although you can unsubscribe at any point and (I think) request any money in your account be refunded.I love the way you can interact with the wine makers and that they can directly respond to your reviews and comments.I haven’t had a bad bottle yet. I think some of the comments around delivery are fair and this is an area that requires some focus. But I guess it is difficult to fully mitigate when using third party companies.Overall I’d recommend wholeheartedly.
NakedWines	GB	Delivery is terrible	09 September 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Delivery is terrible. You may get it before or after the due delivery date. This happened previously. Not good enough.
NakedWines	GB	Your wallet is naked	08 September 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I ordered one time and they enrolled me into a subscription automatically and charge £25 a month. A shameful way to do business. Will definitely black list Naked wine. Your wallet is naked to them.

Honestly we wouldnt use anyone else.
NakedWines	GB	Useless…	06 September 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I previously gave this shower a 5 star review but, as ever, it's delivery is a joke. I gave them the benefit of the doubt as I felt (at the time) they handled the issue really well. Now though, I've been waiting in all afternoon for a delivery shown to have been meant to be here three hours ago at the latest. The tracking app for Yodel is just lies with the delivery driver showing as being 2 stops then one stop away for well over two hours now. One minute the driver had moved to very near me, then went back to where it was before. More lies from Yodel (and, by default, Naked). They refuse to do anything about their deliveries which lots of people find very problematic. If you try and use the 'contact us' section, all you get is their stupid AI called Nacho which is about as much help as an actual nacho. I'm cancelling my subscription with them as a result as enough is enough. If they won't do anything about repeated delivery issues, it's time (very) loyal customers do something and ditch them.
NakedWines	GB	Nice wine if I ever get it	05 September 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I have ordered cases of wine on seven occasions, the first order the delivery was awful but I gave them the benefit of the doubt, I then had no problems until my last two deliveries where I have been told the order was coming then it doesn't then it doesn't arrive the next day, then the delivery company Yodel say they cannot find my address, it is not difficult. Once would be ok but to happen twice is not acceptable and to get the same excuses the second time. Do not bother with this company it is not worth the effort.

It takes some trying to find ones you like, but there are some real gems in the selection.  Spending a bit more gest you some fantastic wines at good prices. Beats paying £8-£12 a bottle in the super market for average wines.
NakedWines	GB	This is not a trustworthy site	01 September 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	This is not a trustworthy site. Even if you get a gift card, they purposefully arrange the site so you have to spend your own money alongside this money they’ve already received. They intentionally deceive people and create arbitrary minimum bottles so you have to spend your own money despite already having enough. The Angel scheme is another way for them to try and fill their pockets rather than benefit their customers.

They put pressure to buy by putting free offers with time limits, I also provided feedback on 2 wines I didn't like. The blurb, promises refunds or replacement but I didn't get any.  Be wary.Since this post, Naked Wines have been in touch by email and have been great in resolving my concerns.  The team personally rang me to seek a resolution.  They have gone to a lot of effort and ensured I received my free offer and added a discount.  Well done

NakedWines	GB	A gift that cost me £48?	15 August 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	A gift that cost me £48?! A family member generously gave me £100 voucher to spend on the site. The voucher didn’t work and got passed between the voucher company and naked wines. Once the voucher was added to my account I was excited to order £100 worth of gifted wine, however it then cost me a further £48 to make up the order to 12 bottles. What a scam - you should have £100 box options for customers, a gift shouldn’t cost the recipient. Then to topIt off it hasn’t arrived today as promised. It’s delayed with the courier. Using this company for a gift voucher ? Don’t bother go to Tesco and buy £100 worth of wine better value for money
NakedWines	GB	READ SMALL PRINT, subscription scammers!!	15 August 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I purchased a case of wine with a voucher for 60% off but firstly I had to spend over £170. After I received the wine, the following month, I noticed £25 had been taken out of my bank account for no apparent reason. After speaking with my bank it seems to be a monthly subscription payment I must of agreed to when making the initial purchase. ALWAYS READ THE SMALL PRINT! Lesson learnt.

NakedWines	GB	Weird concept	10 August 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Weird concept. The wine is no cheaper than elsewhere, you have to pay for delivery (many companies offer this for free), and there’s quite a high threshold to actually be allowed to order anything (I think 12 bottles).

NakedWines	GB	This is a great idea in principle that…	30 July 2022	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	This is a great idea in principle that is currently being ruined by poor strategy. Why do you have to order a minimum of 12 bottles at a time? I’d far rather buy 3 very good bottles for an occasion than 12 average ones. The limit should be on order value rather than quantity, I can’t think of anywhere else than uses quantity as a limiting factor for placing an order.I cancelled my Angel subscription due to this and got a full refund for the £150 credit that I’d saved up. In all likelihood I’d still be using Naked if they were more flexible about purchasing options. Sort it out!
NakedWines	GB	Magnum freebie not received…	29 July 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Used my £60 account credit and wanted to take advantage of a free magnum of red wine worth £29.99. Had to add 12 bottles to my basket (more than I wanted since I can’t actually drink right now - I’m pregnant - and would have just ordered 6 with the £60). Added magnum and was excited by discount, only to receive just the 12 bottles, no magnum. Reached out to Naked wines who said magnum offer had expired (How did I add it to my basket and checkout then?) and offered me £19.99 as a goodwill gesture added to my account. Feel like I’ve been sold these bottles under false pretences and the £20 is a waste of time since I’d have to place another order to redeem it. Please make this right, Naked Wines.
NakedWines	GB	Caitlin	28 July 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Naked Wines provides a really good service. Me and my partner have used on and off for a while now as not in the position to maintain to constant subscription but never had any issues with delivery or their customer services. Always good bottles of wine and lots of variety. Another plus is they make cancelling so straight forward, not like other subscription services!
NakedWines	GB	5 star company..love them	27 July 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I've been a customer now for quite some years, their online account is very easy and simple to navigate (don't understand other reviews about complications regarding subscriptions) you can change and ammend anything at a click of a button. I opt for a monthly direct debit and then pop on to order what wines I like every few months - as you've built up a little kitty it doesn't feel so bad when you spoil yourself to a really good case, and more importantly, at the same time your money is helping support small independent business's. I recommend that you always go on and rate the wines you've had as their suggestions based on your personal taste is in my opinion a first class service. I can't remember the last time I've had a bad/mediocre bottle of wine.Don't like the wine? Without a mention of a quibble I'm refunded with helpful and personal feed back from perfect customer service folk rather than some bot at the other end.I can honestly say the prices are matched to a reasonable supermarket price but can guarantee I'll never have to designate another bottle of wine just for cooking again, and when I treat myself to a decent quality you know its going to be a good bottle.Keep up the good work Naked wines Love being an Angel 😘
NakedWines	GB	Cancelled my subscription ages ago	25 July 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Cancelled my subscription ages ago, then out of the blue, over a year after I cancelled, I received six bottles of wine and was charged for them without my consent (basically the opposite of the subscription service they are supposed to be). I spoke to their customer service who explained I had set something up to automatically reorder 6 bottles of a specific wine when it became availableI had no recollection of doing so. However, agreed to pay it, and was reassured by them that my account was totally closed and it would not happen again.Lo and behold 6 months later. Another 6 bottles arrive and over £100 taken from my bank account.Please can I have my money back, I don’t want your wine!

But then they would not let me back in on that email. I am now in the situation I want to close the account again, but the site won’t let me do so. Instead the send me to a bot, who cannot and will not help or find the right help which means they are keeping my details on record way beyond legal limit. Very disappointed!

NakedWines	GB	Couple of things:	11 July 2022	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	"Couple of things:1.) their promo material. So very many vouchers are sent out saying how much you can save, use the vouchers and get discounts, bla bla. What it doesn't say is per account you can only ever use 1 voucher - EVER. So much money wasted on paper that cannot be used.2.) entry ""gift"" of a number of pounds (in my case £10). Lies. This is not a gift. this is a virtual amount of money that perpetually sits in your account. It is _never_ spent. And if you want to leave, they take it back even if you've purchased from their site.3.) the wines part 1. I appreciate they say they're trying to help / promote the ""little"" guys. However, saying your customers get something for a cheaper price when it's the only place to buy the product, is not a cheaper price. It's just _the price_. So miss-advertising lies.  4.) the wines part two. The wines in their collection are, in my opinion, expensive and _not_ any better than supermarket wines. Posh names, fun stories, but quality and taste wise, pretty darn similar to what your local grocer stocks.I was hoping to ""give back to the little guy"" by paying the slightly more expensive price, but you _must_ buy 12 bottles at a time, you pay for delivery, you never get to actually use their £10 ""gift"", their promotional vouchers are lies so, thanks, but no thanks. Good luck and goodbye."
NakedWines	GB	Do not fall for Naked Wines - they trick you into thinking you will receive an offer.	11 July 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Naked Wines sent me a voucher in the post clearly addressed to myself. It was a £30 discount on a case of wine and two free glasses. I tried to use it and the site barred it on the basis I had previously received an offer. That previous offer was nearly a year ago and why did Naked Wines send me another if I was not eligible? This took time to resolve and I had to speak to a representative to do so.  Dreadful, time wasting company.

NakedWines	GB	a shadow of the formerly great company	01 July 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	This used to be a company delivering top tier wine with top tier service. That’s now not the case. Yodel, only recently popped to the post as worst courier by Hermes/Evri are their courier of choice. That’s who they’re now blaming for their customer service being so bad. Hint: when you’ve chosen a terrible courier, it’s your fault when it all goes pear shaped. I was poised to place another order to find the offer they’d applied had vanished from my account. No answer on email or chat bot. I’ve now closed my account and it will take a week to get all my money back. You could have kept me as a customer very easily but several opportunities were missed to do this.

NakedWines	GB	A very happy angel.	29 June 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I have been using Naked wines for many years. On the odd occasion, when things go wrong, the top quality customer service proves itself more than competent. But that is very infrequent,  and for the majority of the time,  I have received an excellent choice of outstanding wines, delivered to my door in an extremely efficient manner. Top marks to a top company.

Turns out this is not strictly true as you have to pay extra for delivery and then invest £25 a month. I'm sure the offer is vey good just try being honest in your letters.

NakedWines	GB	Patronising	24 June 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I dislike their patronising 'chummy' emails. I dislike the fact they use Yodel as the delivery service. I dislike the fact that their wines are unique to them, so have no independent reviews.

NakedWines	GB	The only wine supplier a man could need.	23 June 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Naked wines are right there at the top of businesses in the UK. Customer service, Morals and social responsibility all feature high on their list. In addition their customer promise and the quality of the wines they offer make it hard to find a single thing to complain about.They always seem to be open to customer suggestions and enquiries are answered quickly and politely.Well done Naked Wines, the only wine supplier a man could need.

They offer a free bottle with orders of 12, and I’ve recently been offered 3 free bottles!  They offer online wine tasting courses and some wine events.  It’s all very impressive! And the people are lovely - real people 😊
NakedWines	GB	Great wines & service	23 June 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Like another review, I'm amazed at the negative comments given my experiences to date when calling up with an issue - rarely does it take more than a few rings to get through and everyone is extremely polite and helpful to the extent, I'd say, they're the best out there at customer service and knowledge of their business. It appears there may be an issue with email correspondence which some have faced, however overall they seem to have exactly the right culture to complement the wines they sell.

NakedWines	GB	Online service is appalling	22 June 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Online service is appalling.  Tried to buy wine 4 times.

NakedWines	GB	Fantastic Company, really helpful	22 June 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I've been using Naked Wines for years and they always give impressive service. Even their sales pitch is friendly and helpful.This particular case was a gentle nudge for me to buy a case of wine.  The team, particularly Jamie, were really pleasant and helpful. A very reliable company with excellent wine. It's a pleasure doing business.

I was informed a pre arranged delivery would be late. I sent 2 emails no response. I had a conversation on chat the agent didn't make any attempt to resolve the problem. I was disappointed by their dismissive response. I cancelled then sent an email asking for confirmation of cancellation. Guess what no response. Great idea but poor customer service.

All wines sent are awesome and much better than other wine clubs. Naked Wines also seems to be a business with heart, as they seem to fund a lot of winemakers around the world. I took about half an hour just to admire the labels and packaging of each bottle. Had to cancel for now, but highly recommend this wine service and club. Quality wines, top notch service.

NakedWines	GB	Great Website & Wines	18 June 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Just placed another order for a LARGE box of Australian wines.

NakedWines	GB	Beware of fraudolent charges!	16 June 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Beware of fraudolent charges!They scam people charging 25 pound a month, I just discovered they charged me in the last two months even if I have bought no wine from them.I will call their customer support and we'll see how hard will be having my money back.What a disappointment, what a scam!
NakedWines	GB	I am a customer of Naked Wines	16 June 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I have been trying to reach out to Naked ones for a couple of weeks now to change my delivery address since I moved. I have paid for the last shipment but unfortunately it never arrived...At first, they were in France doing Team Building.. Later on, I have sent them an email last week which was supposed to be responded within 24 hours. I am still waiting a response and there is no way to talk to a real person other than a robot via chat!!They are good if everything is going well but unfortunately it is a bad experience if you need to talk to somebody and change something..Not recommended if you are planning a move for sure
NakedWines	GB	Double Charged	16 June 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	First, I should point out that this review is not for the wines we bought, but for the poor customer service, which I needed due to the company charging my account twice within a minute of my first and last order.The order was for 6 bottles of wine with a £30 discount on our first order - the balance being £34.99. However, Naked Wines charges me 2x£34.99 on 10 June 2022.I have requested assistance in the matter twice; once via the site message option, and the second via help atnakedwine.comThe ignored message, and no refund as yet.As a new customer of Naked wines, I am less than impressed by your conduct when it comes to your practice of taking two payments of £34.99 within a minute of my promotional purchase on 10 June 2022. I will not be a returning customer and will be sure to leave feedback on Trustpilot in due course.Can you explain why to took two payments from my account, and why they had different ICONs? Was this an act of deception?ON #42031156
NakedWines	GB	After reading some of the negative…	15 June 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	After reading some of the negative responses, I am very surprised.The company tells you up front about their business model and the fact that a small amount of money will be charged each month. This the collects in your Nakedwines account and will be used up when orders are placed.The best wines that I have ever tasted have all been from Nakewines and I always highly recommend this company to my friend and family.One request I would make from them is to try to source some more trendy/niche/hyped wines, for example, no sulphite added / orange wine / natural wine. This would mean that we could order all of our wine from one place. (and have categories for them)Anyway, keep up the good work!Ruslan Carter

They have a huge selection to choose from, you get extremely useful information about each wine and everyone is so knowledgable. I love reading every email, taking opportunities to be part of online tastings and learning all about what I am buying and drinking as well as a bit more about my own personal taste. If I ever have a query they are always available to chat online and are very useful.

I have tried to purchase many times, the website shows errant messages, and I have sent -to no avail-countless emails, with no responses, but plenty of promotions.Their before and after sales is quite disgraceful, and I have asked for two days, for the return of my £75 funds.No replies again, and this is the biggest gripe, the sales/internet teams are lacking in Customer Service-which is a great shame.Alan HallCherry TreesBecclesA response this afternoon:Hi Alan, I hope you are well today. First of all, please let me apologise for the multiple issues you have had, this is definitely not up to our usual standards and I have passed the feedback on to the relevant teams. I'm also sorry for the delay in us getting back to you, most of us were off for the bank holiday so we are catching up with emails we have missed. I can confirm I have now cancelled your account and your money has been refunded back to you, please note though it can take 3-5 business days to appear as available in your bank. Again I am sorry for the negative experience you have had with us, we certainly don't want our customers feeling like this, and we will as best we can to avoid similar issues in the future. Best wishes, and thank you for your support over the years. Megan @ Naked Wines

NakedWines	GB	Disappointed	04 June 2022	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	Disappointed. Trying to order some wine but my account is in credit, more than the cost of the order.  Order fails because it is trying to take money from a card of zero pounds.  They don't seem to have a process of taking  credit only. Can't get through to customer services to explain, they always seem to be shut..  The only way I can get this order is to put the whole amount on a different card, thereby bypassing my credit - ludicrous.I've now been told its my fault for not having a valid credit card - oh. how strongly may I disagree. Again, CS is shut and their BOT is useless.  All we ask for is businesses to admit their shortcomings and provide a resolution, not just blame innocent customers !!

NakedWines	GB	Cancelled my account months ago due to…	31 May 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Cancelled my account months ago due to being dissatisfied.  I received a corked bottle and complained.  I received a patronising response from the grower and no refund for this single bottle.  So much for the guarantee.  Eventually I received an automated email asking why I had cancelled and it was only then I received the refund.  I had already cancelled the account and it remains closed. They confirmed my account had been cancelled.  My login page clearly shows “ We’re sorry to see you’ve handed in your wings… If you have a change of heart, we’d love to have you back.”THEY WILL NOT ALLOW YOU TO CANCEL YOUR CREDIT CARD NUMBER UNLESS YOU ADD A NEW ONE.  THIS EFFECTIVELY REMOVES YOUR ABILITY TO STOP THEM FROM TAKING FURTHER FUTURE UNAUTHORISED PAYMENTS WHENEVER THEY WANT.Today I noticed by chance that on my Amex card there is a pending charge for a case of wine from them. The online Naked Wine account shows they are sending me a case of wine with the payment charged to my account.  There was a delivery charge. The order had a £10 account balance credit which they have never refunded. I tried contacting them.  The “chat” is closed and it is clear they do not want to receive emails because their contact details only has the chat option.  What a palaver.  They really shouldn’t be trying to send wine and charging to a cancelled account customer.  Their system should handle this.  So if you want to spend the hour I’ve spent trying to cancel this and failing and avoid all this rubbish do not open an account.Sadly, these reviews do not allow zero points score hence adding a one point value to their score.

I hadn't signed in since June 2021 so I looked to see if I could find the order and signed in and I couldn't see anything. Next thing I know, money has just gone out of our account taking my husband almost past his overdraft. I have not ordered a thing. I am currently waiting to tell the bank that this transaction is money that has been illegally taken out of my husbands account. Please be aware of this if you cancel. Keep an eye on your account. They might just randomly send you something almost a year after you've cancelled without you even asking.

NakedWines	GB	Not impressed by this lot	17 May 2022	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	Not impressed by this lot - they use what appear to be genuine 'offers' to get you to buy their wine then restrict it to rather average and basis white. red or mixed cases they have chosen. You simply cannot beat majestic at the end of the day - choice, great value and lovely staff on hand to help - plus you get to actually taste the wine too before buying !

NakedWines	GB	Lousy delivery and non existent customer service	07 May 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	It takes  a lot for me to leave a bad review but Naked wines are really frustrating, my last delivery never arrived when stated but hoped that was a one off, ordered my wine for Friday as my day at home , never came again, tried via customer services but gave up as they couldn’t contact the delivery company, got a message at 1am to say it had been delivered but it hasn’t, with several days notice it should be possible to deliver when people are at home, and stop hiding behind staff working from home as a excuse for poor service as your web site explains, other wine companies are much better.
NakedWines	GB	Naked Wine for all	06 May 2022	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	I was introduced to naked wine by BPS members and since I started buying my wines from them, I have improved in treating myself and my friends with brilliant wines.

NakedWines	GB	Great concept, Excellent Company	05 May 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I've been with Naked Wines since 2009 and it's great to see a little company grow from strength to strength. The wines are great tasting and great value and the fact I order what I want when I want it rather than have anything dumped on my doorstep is a real bonus. Never had a problem with delivery or payments- they just seem to get it right every time.Thank you team- keep up the good work :)Jon
NakedWines	GB	Great and friendly communication	02 May 2022	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	"Great and friendly communication. Impressed with that. Market prices too expensive. Angel prices more acceptable but still overpriced. My major issue is that there is no mention to the varieties of grapes in Nu (Portugal), Primitivo (Italia), etc. I am wine lover and it is more important to know which grapes and what kind of barrels it staged at than having a ""thank you angels for your support"" message. I was looking for a wine, not a postcard. ;) I hope there is a improvement on that and a 5-star rating might come along."

They obviously focus on easy-up-front wines but they tend to be sweet, with no balance, acidity or finish.  And their marketing comms are pretty smug and self-satisfied.  Shame - as its a nice concept all in all.
NakedWines	GB	I’m really enjoying the wines.	29 April 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I’m really enjoying the wines.You know you’ve got a good thing going on, when you reach the penultimate glass…and despite being (mildy) merry, something in that bottle makes you want to pick it back up and study it (as a potential reminder for the future).Personally, I really like the thought that goes into this whole ‘Angels’ community/experience: a unique and diligent touch.The chap who delivers my box is friendly. Service is prompt.I like their offers too. Obviously, these are carefully planned, but they make sense to me. They ‘connect’ with me, the consumer. It feels more ‘invitation’ than onus.So far, so good!

Two days after, the package was delivered on time, and then right afterwards a pending payment registered on my account from the day I made the order got bumped up from 0 to the full price of the order, I'd effectively paid for this twice now.upon calling customer support, they told me I'd have to wait a few days to get this money back, though my bank explained I could get this urgently if provided with a document that claims naked wines don't intend to claim and keep the payment.the customer service line explained that they would still be on till 6, although no one answered the phone or replied to any of the emails I'd sent asking for the document, and now I have to wait for the next day.essentially i was charged a bit less than the money I'd saved with the voucher on a day where I had to be booking plane tickets. customer support became unresponsive at a crucial time and now I have to wait a day to book. I don't understand why this payment had to be duplicated to begin with but a string of late replies and inconsistent customer service means that now I might be paying extra out of my pocket because I will be at least a day late to book and unless NakedWines plan to compensate me for this at all then this one order of wine would be the peskiest most unexpected roadblock to our travel plans that could have easily been avoided

NakedWines	GB	Naked Wines Does All the Heavy Lifting for you....	27 April 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Naked Wines suits me exponentially. As a single person of a certain age with too much to do all the time this system works brilliantly.  Naked Wines takes all the heavy lifting out of making sure I have really nice wine in my wine rack for when people come.  The monthly fee one pays also means that you have money 'money in the bank' when you need to lay out for an occasion.

I enjoy trying new wine, learning about and supporting the wine makers and especially getting to meet them on the taster days. In nine years it has only gone wrong twice and both times the problems were swiftly rectified and replacement wines sent. The website is really informative and builds your profile so you have confidence in trying new wine and every month you are offered a bonus bottle. Thank you for nine great years. Cheers!
NakedWines	GB	I DID KNOW WHAT BOTTLE OF WINE I WAS DRINKING BY THE WAY!!!	21 April 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I have just left for a second time (stupidly being enticed back by an offer) due to the insulting way I have been dealt with when complaining about a bottle of wine. I never ask for a refund, but stupidly did on this occasion only to have abuse and accusations that it was all somehow my fault. Despite sending photos of the bottle which clearly showed a best before date of 2022, I was told that I didn't know what wine I was reviewing and it had a use by date of 2021 so it was my fault for drinking it. Thanks Naked!

NakedWines	GB	Pretty poor	17 April 2022	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	Pretty poorThe wine is not brilliant. (Well one or two of the box I initially ordered were ok)  They don’t respond to cancellation requests. I’ve tried to talk to them but they are not interested - and still they try and take money off me and send me emails despite promising not to. It’s possible they have been having a bad time but I’d rather try somewhere else!Just to be very clear I’ve tried to unsubscribe since Christmas! I’ve had a email from them today. Let’s see if my response is effective!
NakedWines	GB	Love it	15 April 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Like most, I joined to get the discounted wine with a voucher.  I really enjoyed every bottle of wine and was hooked.  Since then I have ordered a further few cases, which I have also enjoyed very much.  I really like trying all the different wines and have never had one that I didn’t enjoy.  I find that the wine is much better than what I used to buy in the supermarket.  I have no intention of going back.  We’ll done Naked Wines, great wine delivered quickly.
NakedWines	US	Naked Wines is a scam, period	15 April 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	They entice you with an introductory offer of a variety of wine selections. In the meantime they use your payment details to set up by stealth, a so-called subscription and help themselves to your hard money in return for a so called “Angels” subscription. A monthly deduction of £25 that gets you NOTHING,ZERO if you don’t add more money to buy more wine you don’t need. This is a scam and FRAUD. I have cancelled and am demanding a refund of all money deducted from my account. This is a warning. Avoid Naked Wines if you don’t want to lose your money or become an alcoholic trying to “get back value for your money”

My total collection was over 100£.But when I ordered Easter Survival pack, they have deducted from my bank account and the accumulated amount over the month is shown as zero in my account held with naked wines.

NakedWines	GB	Great way to enjoy wine	10 April 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I have used NW for about two years now following one of their introductory offers. The wines are very good and the fact you can even communicate with the wine makers is a big plus. My only gripe is that communication can be hit and miss at times and the online help not very good. About an hour ago I get an email regarding the plight of Katie and to update my card details. I did this 7 days ago by calling their number and having a member of staff do it. Therefore I don't know why I get the email and see this as quite frustrating. The delivery of my wines has been very good and always when they say.

NakedWines	GB	Pushy marketing	09 April 2022	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	I got a voucher and bought a case of wine. The wine was excellent, but I didn’t realise I was also being signed up for a subscription - obviously there must have been something I ticked but it really was not clear! There was an email the day before the subscription left my account, but I was on holiday and didn’t read it - thinking it was just another email from Naked Wines (they send a lot). I’m sure this company is good if you regularly want to buy a set amount of wine each month and they have lots of freebies, but I find their marketing very pushy. I have now cancelled the subscription. It was quite easy but took a bit of searching on their website.

Most of the bottles I have bought have been fabulous. I love how the winemaker responds to your review. I have also found the wine to be much better quality (and slower to drink and enjoy) than your standard supermarket/off license wines. The customer service is second to none as well, give these guys a go and you won't be dissapointed. And even if you are, they all do their best to make you feel happier again.

NakedWines	GB	3 weeks and still no sign of my wine	30 March 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	It’s been 3 weeks, 2 shipments, one cancelled after 2 weeks, the second one late for 3 days now, and none arrived to my place. It seems to be a problem that other customers faced (despite the customer service saying there was no specific issue with the deliveries at the moment). So whereas they followed up regularly, I still haven’t seen my wine.So I might change my review later if I receive the wine but working with a poor shipping company makes the overall experience extremely bad and for a subscription company is a very poor strategic decision. So stop working with Yodel or get ready to lose customers

Indeed I only just discovered that Naked Wines have been taking £25 from my bank account for almost a year now!! So today I went on the website and cancelled my subscription. Straight away my balance went from £285 (which I have paid) to £0.00. Surely cancelling is my choice and I should still have been able to buy wine to the value of £285, you can't just keep the money!!!! Sick and tired of scammers and chancers in this world.

NakedWines	GB	BEWARE OF THE CATCH ON THIS SPECIAL OFFER	27 March 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Last year i July I purchased a case of wines from NAKEDWINES on a special offer and was not aware of the catch if you accept this special offer you automatically pay a monthly subscription of £25. Today Sund. 27th March 22 i checked my Amex statement and noticed a £25 monthly charge from NAKED WINES  dating back August 21. Quite disappointed as i didn't intend then to subscribe. In other words i paid to-date £200 for the privilege of being a NW member and getting nothing in return.  I feel i have being scammed!! As a result i put a stop with my provider.
NakedWines	GB	Took money from my account out of the…	27 March 2022	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	This a revised review, after my original comment about being charged for a box despite cancelling the membership. I’d never had problem with Naked Wines’ service previously and Ive always found it a good value (that is, if you wanted bit more than a supermarkets’ own brand). Also, as proven here, their customer service is eager to engage with customers and it’s always a good sign.However, I’d appreciate if there was a reminder about the subscription to the boxes from individual growers when we attempt to cancel or suspend the membership. Would it be possible to make it more explicit? Thank you.Update: Naked Wine’s customer support have been in touch and actually cared about the issue. They have already taken action to adjust the UI/UX management of subscriptions to make it easier for some. This only shows that they actually care about their customers. Thank you, as it convinced me to give it a go again in the future.

NakedWines	GB	Duped?	22 March 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I seem to have ended up paying Naked Wines £25 a month, without knowing how on earth this has happened.  I did take advantage of an offer, but I didn't realise I was also agreeing to them taking more money off my credit card. I'm not sure how this happened but I feel duped.I have resolved this by contacting my credit card company.  They have put a stop on the payment.  I am also hoping that my £25 will be returned.  This is a shame as I would otherwise been happy to return to Naked Wines.  However, I can see from the thread below that this is a recurring theme so it is unlikely to be unintentional any more.  Once is an accident, twice is suspicious but thrice is very naughty!

NakedWines	GB	I wish to raise a formal complaint…	21 March 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	"I wish to raise a formal complaint against your company for using a delivery driver who failed to leave my order.First of all it's important to state that I am registered permanently disabled, which by itself is not a problem as I can get around the house, however, I can not do it at the speed of light.So today at around 2.20- 2.30pm, there was a knock at the door.I was hoping it was my delivery though, despite getting an email from yourselves telling me:""We plan to deliver your case on Monday 21/03/2022.You'll get another email (and text message if you've signed up to receive them) from our courier on the day your wine is out for delivery.""I did not get another email.So I went to the front door, but there was no-one there. Maybe he's at the back door, I thought, so I closed the front door, went through to the back door, but there was no one there either.I walked up the steps to my street level to see a tall, bearded man climb into a white van. While I'm yelling for him to stop, he ticked something off on a clipboard(?) and drove off leaving me without my wines!I then had the rigmarole of having to stop what I was going to do, fire up my PC, find your email, go to your website and complain.Your ""live chat"" chap told me it was delivered. How was it delivered without my signature? This had to be signed for. Or if he did leave it without a signature, where did he hide it? My neighbour and I looked everywhere. Or did he scale my locked back gate with a sixer box under his chin and hide it in the compost heap?To say I am furious and frustrated beyond measure, is an understatement. You can also close the account because we refuse to be treated in this manner. You use these low paying delivery companies who treat their staff appallingly and wonder why things go awry. This would never have happened at one time because service used to be paramount.Well, you certainly lost my business."

NakedWines	GB	Lost a loyal customer with their scam	18 March 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I normally give a company time to respond when contacting them as I did this time but I haven't received a response via the app so I am here to rate their performance.We have been members of Naked Wines for some time now and always look forward to the treat of ordering a case of 12 bottle every 4 months or so. We ignore the barrage of requests to increase our monthly payment in favour of the periodic treat however recently we decided to order ready for summer and although it's not 4 months we were prepared to pay more to fulfill the order.To our surprise  the balance was £60 less than what was expected and there was a a shipment of 6 bottles of the same wine on it way to us. We never signed up for a subscription to a particular wine as the variety is more important to us. If we wanted to get the same wine especially SB we would have gone to Costco and bought a good NZ SB like Villa Maria. So we were disappointed in Naked Wines to the point where I associate them now with the same scams as Brittania Music club did in the 80s sending anything to you. To me this should be that I am in control of what I buy. I will take advice but ultimately its my choice.

Made the order which cost me £114.99 - £75 = £52.87, in retrospect this should have been a red flag £114.99 - £75 does not equal £52.87 the real price should have been £39.99 but I didn't notice at the time of purchase... Anyway this is not even the worst part, after the purchase they shown me the wines that will be delivered to me and after a quick glance it was immediately obvious that they didn't cost £114.99 in the first place, it was instead around £80, so they actually charged me more then they should have in two different ways.The f*ing balls on this company...

Very bad company. Most likely set up just to scam people."
NakedWines	GB	I got overcharged	15 March 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Wine is nice. For some reason they keep charging me though. I placed an order ONCE, I paid for it and that's it. Yesterday I was checking my bank statement and £25,00 was taken without me placing any other order. I am 100% sure I didn't subscribe as I had no intention to, so I contacted their customer service.  I am waiting for a solution now, but apparently they are claiming they CAN'T find my account so they are not able to cancel the payments. That's unacceptable and I hope they sort it soon. Please keep an eye in your bank statements just in case.

NakedWines	GB	Best place to buy wine	07 March 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Naked Wines are great. Truly lovely wine, transparency with the winemakers, friendly community and a very cost-effective way of buying good wine. You also get to learn more about the wines you like and the story behind them. Definitely a step-up from buying wine in supermarkets, much more personal and much nicer! My first case arrived late because the delivery company couldn't find me and Naked Wines were so helpful, organised a re-delivery and a free gift for me - they fully took it on as their problem to solve even though it was the delivery company's mistake. Lovely company, fantastic wine and for once, decent marketing emails! I'm sure you can switch them off if you want but Naked Wines actually write to you with interesting updates with an eloquent style :)
NakedWines	GB	Wine good, charging process is not	07 March 2022	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	1st of all- Wine is good quality and quick delivery.Strange thing with payment though- when ordered they take a pre authorisation payment and then another payment of the same value when the order ships. According to my bank it takes 31days for a pre authorisation charge to be returned. So I will be out of pocket for 31days. This is the 1st time I have ever heard of this charge when buying anything on line. As I said, wine is good but not really worth the hassle of waiting to get your money back so I would try elsewhere to purchase who don’t charge in that way.The two charges were taken 1 minute apart and I have it in writing from my bank that it takes 31 days to return.It is certainly not a simple process.

NakedWines	GB	Hey watch out they sign you up to invest/ pay £25 a month	06 March 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Hey don’t get me wrong the wines are good and the initial deals on crates are great… but when you suddenly see money taken out of your bank account without knowledge you realise it’s the sort of company that think it’s acceptable to subtly sign you up for something that you didn’t know you were signing up for it’s much less palatable…. Let’s see how easy and quick  it is  for them to cancel membership and refund money taken without permission / knowledge!!!  Most disappointed in their approach to business… shame on the… Dirty dealing Angels!
NakedWines	GB	Terrible marketing strategy at the vunerable	05 March 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Love to know why Naked Wines are sending letters to an elderly family member who has dementia and is suffering the effects of a previous alcohol addiction.The letter contained offers, discounts, all enticing ...Never done business with them, never will, so quit with junk mail.Guessing they don't give a dam what impact alcohol has on some people when they randomly send this crap out as long as they make money.

I never agreed to that, I only bought these wines as a Christmas present plus I don't even drink. This is a very bad practice, scaming people like this. Please please people don't order from this  company because they will keep on collecting money from your bank account without your authorisation. Please don't try to take my money from my account because I did not order any wines from you.

NakedWines	GB	Initial review. No wines yet and an UPDATE.	02 March 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	"Full review to be submitted once wines have been tried. 2* for now for very unusual business practice. Naked Wines has a very tricky marketing ploy that isn't worded clearly when you join. Seems you commit yourself to investing £25.00 a month into this firm which you get back in form of discounts plus against your order. This really wasn't made clear on joining and seems the use of diverting techniques (multiple choice questions, interaction) and long scripts are the order of the day. You'll end up missing the 'catch'. Now, I ordered the introductory offer. I'm not a heavy drinker, but I'd like to taste the wines this group sells. If indeed I am impressed then maybe I might join their Angel scheme. It may be worth it, but I want to try the goods before I commit myself. I worked it all out after placing the order and received the follow up email from Naked Wines clarified stuff. I was a bit horrified. I logged on and ended immediately my subscription to the Angel scheme. Let me try the stuff first BEFORE I commit myself. You say you have 30 days to decide? I probably won't drink these 6 wines in 30 days. More like 45 days. Then I'll decided. All very cloak and dagger this marketing model. We will see, but all beware what you're signing up too. Awaiting my 6 bottle trial. It's paid for. Will taste them all then decide.UPDATE: 04/02/22: Comical. I expected delivery today from Yodal. I have been tracking the order all day working from home. At 14:54 I check the tracker to be advised ""We tried to deliver your parcel but it was refused due to damage. Please contact your sender"". I WAS IN ALL DAY and I did not see nor refuse anything. What is this nonsense??? What lies??? So, is this the firm they will use for future deliveries??? Not happy with the whole thing."

NakedWines	GB	So easy to place order, plus great value. A genuine great offer	23 February 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	What a breath of fresh air to place an order with a company with no problems. I had previously been an 'Angel' with Naked Wines but circumstances meant that I had to cancel my subscription. I received a letter today offering me a voucher for £30 off any 6x bottles of wine valued at £49.99 or more which is great compared to the vouchers that you get from other wine subscription companies that give you vouchers but can only be redeemed against cases valued at £90. I placed my order and was given a choice of dates for delivery which is great. Normally you are told when the delivery will be then have to rearrange with the courier but with this order I could choose a day that I would be at home.

The language and offers are insulting to one's intelligence and misleading. Their limited time offers are nothing of the sort, I have received dozens of their 'so called' offer vouchers by post, in flyers, with magazines, etc. over the years. It is all just pathetic sales pitches. What does one have to do to prevent their junk mail and offers?

NakedWines	GB	This used to be a great company but…	23 February 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	This used to be a great company but everything has gone so downhill since they were bought by a very large company, expensive prices for mediocre wine in most cases and the service just isn’t what it used to be. After complaining that a bottle of wine was missing from my order (second time it’s happened) they told me as a gesture of goodwill they would refund me the bottle - I mean that’s a refund for the bottle I didn’t get, how an earth is that a gesture of goodwill - subscription cancelled, such a shame as we used to love it
NakedWines	GB	Incompetent and overrated!	22 February 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I thought their wines were overrated as well as being over priced, so decided to cancel my membership in October last year. I’ve just been informed by them that they’ve delivered a case of wine to our previous address, which we didn’t order and have taken money out of our account, which in my book is tantamount to fraud. I just think they’re incredibly incompetent!

NakedWines	GB	What an appalling setup	20 February 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	What an appalling setup. We were given a voucher for £100 as a present, but in order to use it we are going to have to spend additional money to get up to the minimum order of 12 bottles, and the vast majority of the (relatively small) selection of wines are not available to order unless you also pay to become an 'Angel', so I'm caught between keeping the price of receiving a 'gift' not too high, and finding wines that I want and seem to be good value. Go to the Wine Society, people!

NakedWines	GB	Unacceptable methods of getting your subsciption	17 February 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I decided to take advantage of a Naked wine offer using a discount leaflets that came with a product I had bought from another company.   - no subscription was mentioned.  Then I got an email thanking me for signing up to a £25.00 subscription - this is not obvious on the voucher, the site or in terms and conditions.  I CANCELLED IMMEDIATELY AS THIS IS  UNACCEPTABLE.  I will be reporting this to the company who provided the voucher and trading  standards.The reply from Naked is just a sales pitch and blames me for not seeing the pop ups - THERE WERE NO POP UPS!!!!!  The company who supplied the Naked voucher have also checked and they agree that there is no information on the voucher or on the website prior to payment for the box of wine.  They need to try a proper apology and correcting the situation.

NakedWines	GB	WATCH OUT FOR SUBSCRIPTION!	17 February 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	We decided to take advantage of a Naked wine offer….we used one of their discount leaflets that appear from nowhere on a regular basis.. “no subscription necessary”.  WRONG! If you are not careful you are signing up to £25 a month!  Apparently there is a drop down message that explains this when you order your case of wine.  I call this a trick…I was tricked into agreeing to this without even noticing.  I was inundated with emails about naked wine “Angels” which I just deleted and eventually unsubscribed.  Four months later, to my horror (my fault for not checking my statement properly), I found that I had paid £25 a month to Naked wines.  This IS a subscription and I feel I WAS tricked into it.  HOWEVER … thank you to Naked Wines for being so understanding, immediately apologising and refunding my £100.Suggestion….make it clearer!
NakedWines	GB	Love the wine	16 February 2022	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	Love the wine. Very impressed with the wine and the quick service, Didn't realise I'd signed up for a monthly subscription, which would be fine but a case of 12 bottles will probably last me 6/8 months. I will purchase again at some point.
NakedWines	GB	Misleading introductory offer	16 February 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Like plenty of others on here I took up a great introductory offer with no subscription, only to then receive an email saying that £25 was going to be taken out of my account for what is seemingly a subscrition service in everthing but name. The stock response to these complaints is that there was a pop-up that we would have clicked etc etc. Either this pop-up does not exist or the wording is very misleading. I took the time to read all of the wording carefully and at no point was a regular withdrawal from my account mentionedIt should be made very clear to people that when they take up this introductory offer they are signing up for a subscription service. I shall not ne buying from Naked Wines again

NakedWines	GB	I was an angel that hung up my wings.	14 February 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I was an angel that hung up my wings.. then I was sent an offer to come back- so I was mad enough to accept and so wish I hadn’t. The reason I stopped buying was the bad delivery service, damaged goods and just dumped on the doorstep or delayed and arriving days after chosen date. I thought things may have changed so I got my yodel “out for delivery” message I thought will see what state it arrives in - and then “your parcel is delayed”. No reason why, impossible to contact. I emailed Naked to get a “standard” reply - “sorry for the delay but they are on their way”. I reply to the pro forma email saying WHEN? No date or time given.. just on their way… last time it was a week after request, the time before (damaged) and three days late.I have requested a refund same day as I know they can and am awaiting my acknowledgement. The wine is fine although recently increased by £1.00 a bottle in most cases. No reason why.. but the service is atrocious. Better using the supermarket or possible another business.. you need to look at things Naked. I spoke to a manager about this in November.. oh and I am still awaiting their reply..

NakedWines	GB	Wine offer gone wrong...	13 February 2022	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	Wine offer gone wrong... 6 bottles for £20 insane value and noted no extra cost or subscription. A one off cost.Slightly shocked to be signed up to a £25 a month service when the the offer said no subscription necessary! The emails are very miss leading noting the product as a savings account and provide lots of info on discounts. Then after all this guff their is a small bit that says they will tale £25 a month from you. WHY DONT YOU PUT THIS FIRST!!Cancelled the service but caused 1hr on the phone with my bank. Just be upfront if you want us to sign up to a service!The bottles arrived and delivery info was v good. The wine itself has not been incredible yet (2 bottles in) but for the price why not try them out.Frustrating ordeal which could have been avoided if they were just honest and clear about their subscription service / saving product.MAKE YOUR MARKETING EMAILS CLEAR AND PERHAPS YOU'LL HAVE MORE LOYAL CUSTOMERS AND NOT ANNOYED EX CUSTOMERS.

NakedWines	GB	A wine merchant that has really got its act together...	08 February 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	What matters most is the quality of wine available, and in my 3 years with Naked, I've found that your independent suppliers have produced excellent wines at an affordable prices.  There is a broad selection, and if some favourites disappear, there's always plenty of interesting alternatives.  The ratings are helpful, along with information on individual wines as well as producers.  The team at Naked Wines are helpful and friendly, the delivery service is excellent; I've only ever had one delay (1 day) on my monthly order, and leave-if-out instructions are always followed diligently.  I was very impressed in how you kept things going during the pandemic, showing great versatility over couriers and suppliers to keep your customers watered!The free-bottle every month is always appreciated, and I enjoy the easy and intuitive web-site for picking each month's selection.  I've discovered many an enjoyable new wine from all over the world and I've never had to return a bad bottle or one I didn't enjoy.I'd happily recommend the Naked Experience to anyone out there who is looking for good wine at good prices with a nice no-strings relationship and brilliant logistics and delivery!

I knew I was joining a club where money would be taken every month, but safe in the knowledge I'd get any unspent back if I wanted to leave.11 years later, here I still am. Yes there have been issues recently with logistics for various reasons, but Naked always rise above them and do the right thing, which is refreshing. They are also fully engaged on the ecological side, trying to drive sustainability.If you join, you get great wine from independent winemakers, and a great social side
NakedWines	GB	Totally useless, awful customer service	08 February 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Ordered wine a week ago for Saturday delivery for a dinner party, get told Saturday morning they didn’t load it in time so they’ll let me know when I will get it. Get told yesterday it’s coming that evening between 7 and 9 I wait up as usually go to bed early on weeknights as have to leave house early morning, guess what, no delivery again and when you look at the tracker Yodel can’t even tell you when it’s going out!Their wine is normally good but their service is terrible. If you’re ordering wine and need it for a specific date don’t bother with this company.
NakedWines	GB	Not impressed and unknown subscription?	08 February 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Despite to the fact of a quick delivery I am not impressed with the quality of wine.Also I got subscribed for unknown to me membership with 25 quid monthly payments. I just simply took a 6 bottle case for the promotional price of 19.99.It is a false advertisement and considered a steal in e-commerce.Not recommended
NakedWines	GB	Great service, great product	07 February 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Need a great red wine and great customer service? Naked is your best bet. They definitely wowed me.
NakedWines	GB	Amazing experience	07 February 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Amazing experience, had a massive discount voucher with no hidden costs or t&cs, just redeemed and enjoyed.
NakedWines	US	Multi-Year Subscriber	07 February 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	"My wife and I were subscribers for several years.  It's reputable and legit.  On a ""goodness scale"", I would put them at 10 out of 10.  Here's what impressed me the most: when I went to cancel (for reasons that have nothing to do with Naked Wines), it was SUPER easy, just clicking a spot on their site, and they were like ""OK, we'll put your balance back your credit card"", which they did.  That's money I had already paid them, which you might be able to argue was money spent, but because they are GOOD and HONEST, there was no funny business or resistance at all.  If my wife ever gets her pre-Covid taste buds back, we might just re-join.p.s. Karen Birmingham wines are almost always exceptionally good!"
NakedWines	GB	Superb!	07 February 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I joined a few years ago on the recommendation of a friend. Absolutely fantastic service and range of wines, further enhanced by regular e-mails from many of the wine producers. The savings provided on the wines are very good, as are the regular offers. Highly recommended, whether you are a regular purchaser or 1-2 times per year (their Christmas boxes are fantastic).

NakedWines	GB	Great range of excellent wines	06 February 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Great range of excellent wines sourced on a reasonably low cost crowdfunding model. The wine ratings from fellow Angels provide a guide to making purchases based on their experience.
NakedWines	GB	I'm new to wine drinking and had stuck…	05 February 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I'm new to wine drinking and had stuck to supermarket wine until seeing a good starter offer for a box of 12 from naked wines. I enjoy trying different things so the box I received had a good mix at around £50 it was great value. The ability to control my subscription and monthly cost is good and i have the opportunity to rate my wines and decide whether or not to buy them again. I think I will use naked wines as a base stock which I can then supplement with wines I see in the supermarkets to increase my knowledge and generally try new things. No pressure to buy monthly is great as I'm a sporadic drinker and no doubt will go back to beer in a few months
NakedWines	GB	Red wines of started kit both tasted terrible.	05 February 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Had a dinner party and ordered a starter case. Both red wines we opened tasted as if they went off a long time ago and barely drinkable. I was under the impression that these were meant to be highly rated, quality wines. Not sure what wrong in the process, but really sad to see this was not the case.Dreading to open the last red wine, let alone the three whites.
NakedWines	GB	New angel	05 February 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I saw an advert for the company advertising a starter box of wine for £19.99 and thought I’d give it a try. Considering an average half decent bottle is about £6 It sounded excellent value. I checked everything out first before I decided up to buy and I’d  read a few reviews here complaining about money coming out of accounts unexpectedly later down the line, obviously these people didn’t read everything first before buying so I was well prepared before I decided to purchase. I’ve downloaded the app now and I can easily keep track of what I want to do. £25 a month is only the price of one bottle a week so I’m quite looking forward to my angel account and see what wines I can get in the future. Delivery was spot on. My case of six bottles arrived less than 48 hours after ordering. All I have to do is now is to crack open a bottle and sample the goods.
NakedWines	GB	fabolous	05 February 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	absolutely pleased with this company, every bottle that I have received has been top quality. Unlike supermarket wines I feel you are not gambling on quality and taste.

NakedWines	GB	I love these wines!	02 February 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I love these wines!There is such variety, but all are good quality, chosen by the team at Naked Wines.  Any you don't like ( and that's very rare - not had one yet!) they refund the cost.Also I love the fact Independent vineyards, who are passionate about wine, get the chance to sell to us, who drink it, rather than big chains, who don't do them a good service.Naked wines act as the go between, and I love the results!
NakedWines	GB	Avoid	02 February 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Avoid! I ordered a discounted case of 12 bottles of white wine. I would say at least 4 were undrinkably awful. Some came with the bottle description of 'White' or 'Dry'...and that's it! No 'Chardonnay' or 'Sauvignion', just 'White'. Grim.To add insult to injury, there was a hidden subscription involved and they took £25.00 out of my account yesterday. I have been in touch with them and they appear to have cancelled any association I have with them....fingers crossed.I will stick to Tesco in the future, and strongly recommend you do the same.

NakedWines	GB	Beware £25 a month hidden subscription	31 January 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Beware you might get signed up to a subscription without realising!  I thought the prices and voucher were too good to be true, so when I received the first box of wine and it said thanks for becoming an 'Angel' I thought it sounded a bit dodgy, so I checked my online account which said I had signed up for monthly payments of £25!!! :-0  Thankfully it was quite easy to cancel online.
NakedWines	GB	10 years with Naked Wines and still here, enjoying wines made by great people.	31 January 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Have been with Naked Wines about 10 years now and have found all their services to be top notch. We get to be able to speak to our wine producers both online and meeting them when we have tasting sessions. They have all been brilliant. During the lock-downs we had Zoom sessions with Naked Wines and our producers, which gave me something other than Covid to think about.To be honest, it makes me wonder how good it would have been to work for them if life had turned out differently. No complaints though, retired now and they are great at indulging me with one of my passions.

It’s clear that the guys there all have a passion for what they do….it shines through in every bottle and every interaction with them as a business.   The Christmas case was out of this world.

NakedWines	GB	Happy Angel for the 2nd time	30 January 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I have recently returned to Naked Wine having previously been an angel. I generally place an order every 3 to 4 months and have already identified my favourites.I have to say Naked are not like other wine clubs as there is a wine for every taste and budget.Over the years of my 2 membership terms I have been disappointed with only 2 bottles and as soon as I highlighted the issue the cost of that bottle was immediately added to my account no hassle whatsoever.You can get updates from individual growers whom you perhaps enjoy the fruits of their labour and it gives a real feeling of helping others who in turn really appreciate your financial support.You decide when you want the wine it is not automatically sent unless you want to opt in to that process.I would recommend Naked Wines to anyone wanting to sample a good variety of quality wines with no pressure sales.

NakedWines	GB	Usual misleading Scam	29 January 2022	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	Yes I had a promotion voucher from the RAC so took up the offer 6 bottles for £20.00 wine was ok actually ..but no ware on there site in full view do they explain they are going to use your payment card to take £25.00 a month.. It more than  likely is there some ware ... but oh boy they don't want you to find it . I thought to  myself there is nothing for nothing in this world and delphed in to my account I had to set up to redeem the voucher as of course I was paying £20.00 . Its a bit of a scam really but then so many other companies are doing the same. Oh and by the way they set you up with £25.00 to come out of your bank monthly when there lowest amount is actually £20.00 I have cancelled after scanning the site and stumbling across a link to do so

NakedWines	GB	Great Way to Taste Good Wine	28 January 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	How many cups of coffee do you buy during the week at work?? I decided to pay £20 a month to Naked Wines as this helps up and coming vineyard owners who are struggling to safely culture/take care of the vines/harvest vines to make their wine! I know my small amount each month has helped to produce many beautiful wines that would never have been able to be produced due to different circumstances - I also get to choose for my personal selection of wines to be delivered to my door when it suits me! I have tasted wines that only Naked Wine members have been privileged to help reach the end product -The customer and the expert winemakers have been able to continue developing their wines! I have my favourite wines and I love to open my case when it arrived to look at the different bottles! I certainly think it’s a bargain to be able to drink selected wines at reasonable prices from my computer delivered to my door at a time that suits me! I would advise anyone to try Naked Wines some of my neighbours, family and friends have joined due to me gifting them delicious wines!

NakedWines	GB	A unique provider	28 January 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Unlike any other online wine provider as, quite apart from offering excellent examples of your favourite tipple, their selections also take you to wines you might otherwise never try.  On top of that they provide the opportunity for smaller and lesser known vintners to develop their vintages to the mutual advantage both of the grower and to those of us who appreciate their product..

Terrific choice of wines and pricing, and Christmas brings a lovely bonus of goodies with your festive purchase.Lots of interesting wine community posts on the site and an easy to use app makes ordering a breeze.
NakedWines	GB	GREAT! No reason not to experience this unique concept right now.	27 January 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Been with Naked for several months. All the wines I have purchased are from smaller wineries (which is I guess the USP for NW) producing excellent stuff from growers that are really enthusiastic about their products. The wines have broadened my outlook on wine and added a new interest in the producer, the grape, the area, the country of origin and the owners storyline. I used to just drink it! Whilst not getting carried away here (I am cynical by nature) there is a feeling of involvement with NW and their producers. Prompt feedback from producers on any comments you care to make good and bad. if you are unhappy with a wine they will refund you. Ok a couple may have not been to my taste but there was nothing wrong with them so don’t need a refund.There is a wide range which included certain spirits, fortified wines etc and always new wines coming through. You can reserve future vintages (no commitment), favourite a wine and any money you put in through the subscription service is always there. There is always a “free” bottle in your basket each month which stays for a while and provided with 12 Bottle or equivalent order. Cynical me says it is built in to the price but hey, it seems a free and always a great wine!If you have not joined the set up, it is dead easy, no commitment at all and there are loads of ways you can get an amazing intro offer so read all about it! Out of interest I read a handful of duff reviews about poor service, not what they expected etc, it appears to me that they did not read anything about the concept and did not take the trouble to make proper contact with NW to sort a problem out. I have complete confidence in NW if ever there was a problem to resolve - and that is from cynical me.

Of all the wines we have tried so far, only one was not to our taste, and generally we have found the wines very quaffable. Knowing that you are supporting the smaller producers is a extra bonus. Find their prices very comparable, and a nice way to save for a case every few months.

All the wine is superb and of a quality rarely, if ever, a available in the supermarket. Small scale winemakers. Lots of things to get involved in for learning about or discussing wine if you want. Superb xmas box and Christmas zoom party/quiz. Lovely people who run it with real passion. It’s great to understand exactly where your wine has come from and who made it. Once you have found them you won’t go back!

NakedWines	GB	Great independent wine company	26 January 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I have been a member of Naked Wines for a while now and pay £20 per month which gives me access to great wines from around the world and does all the research for me.  My latest purchase was a case from South Africa purchased as a ‘rescue’ case to help the struggling wine producers there impacted by Covid restrictions.  The case has just arrived and the red wine we have just tasted is absolutely excellent and matches any equivalent wines we have bought at a similar price.  I have also purchased a similar case to help the wine producers impacted by the recent flooding in Germany but this has not arrived yet.  I generally buy mixed random cases as I find it exciting to try new bottles and Naked never let me down and introduce me to new tastes.  I have also logged onto to one of their tastings on zoom which was enjoyable and informative.  Delivery by Yodel is usually fine and if there are any problems the case will be replaced.

However having now bought a number of the wines from Naked wine, including their mixed case at Christmas, I have been introduced to winemakers from across the world who I know I would never have discovered if it had not been for Naked Wine.

The wine is superb, excellent value for money and the service is outstanding, e. g. I ordered a case of 12 (plus 1 extra thrown in for free) on Wednesday 3pm, and it arrived next morning in perfect condition, free delivery.The choices available are also excellent: I sometimes like to try wines from less well-known regions such as the Balkans, Greece etc. I've never been disappointed yet.If you're teetering, just do it. You won't be disappointed. And you'll whip the rug from under the boring supermarkets...

NakedWines	GB	Why we like Naked Wines	26 January 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	We signed up to Naked Wines during the first lockdown and we’ve been delighted by the fantastic wine and their Christmas box with gin and other niceties was fantastic too. We like NW’s model supporting the growers and as wine drinkers with relatively little knowledge about wine we love the pre chosen cases NW put together. We like the info too which they provide. A great company with fantastic product and service.
NakedWines	GB	Bad delivery experrience	26 January 2022	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	The very large box was left on my front doorstep, right in front of the door so it would be difficult for me to get out of my house. No indication that the box was being delivered, it was just there when I opened the door.I'm an 82 years old widow who lives on her own. Had the delivery driver had the courtesy to knock on my door I could have asked him to put the box inside my front door in a place where I wouldn't trip over it. I had to leave the box there for a few days as I couldn't move it and there was nobody else around to help me by moving it. Fortunately I was able to push the box to one side of the front doorstep with my feet as I have torn shoulder muscles.Not a good experience. I expect the wine is good, but the delivery experience left much to be desire.

I think its great that as a member I am helping those smaller wine makers, I have yet to have a ""bad wine"" but I obviously have my favourites!

I also try to take advantage of the ‘free‘ bottle which is sometimes available when an order is 12 bottles or more.

NakedWines	GB	Since joining Naked Wines I have become…	26 January 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Since joining Naked Wines I have become far more confident about trying new wines, and knowing that I support small independent wine growers is an added incentive.  The choice of wines is excellent,  and mixed case offers are extremely good value.  I have made use of subscribing to cases of particular wines I've enjoyed, which ensures I will always receive the next vintage.  The website is very informative and helps when making a mixed choice of wines.  Paying a relatively small sum each month means that when I do put in an order there is not such a large amount to pay. This has actually encouraged me to try better wines and be more adventurous in my choices.  Great wines with a great company philosophy.

Prices are always reasonable. You can choose to splash out, but there are many wines just a few pounds dearer than supermarket offerings that give you a considerable leap upwards in flavour and overall quality.

NakedWines	GB	Great Wines	26 January 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Tried Naked Wines for the first time just before Christmas, I saw an offer and decided to give them a go. I’m so glad I did, every bottle of wine was really good and I ordered a further 12 bottles from them, once again there were no disappointments and they threw in a free magnum, which was great! I like the way you pay £25 in each month and then order your wines as you like throughout the year, it just spreads the cost and I don’t need to think about it.Looking forward to my next box which I intend to order next month, yes I recommend Naked Wines 🍷🍷🍾😁

As far as I know it was never recovered.After that poor start things have picked up and there was no record of where he actually delivered it to. . .Deliveries on time now and the process seems to work .I really like the idea of buying from small independent vineyards as this is a major part of the proposition. I understand that as they don't produce as much, they cant sell it as cheap as the supermarkets.I think more should be made of the producers and there techniques - with out giving away the crown jewels of course.Hope this helps!CheersJohn

NakedWines	GB	Different & recommended.	26 January 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I’ve been an Angel (member) for a few years now. I like the concept of a monthly subscription but then choosing wines to fill a case as & when I want them, using the subscription balance that I have built up & then just paying any difference. I also like the idea of a free bottle when I order a full case! To date, I have found quality of wines to be good value (when averaged  out to include the freebie) with a good variety of styles & countries of origin. It’s also nice that the wines on offer are not found on the high street. Web site is informative & easy to use. Delivery has generally been prompt, although a little slower of late, which the company has attributed to COVID related challenges. Overall, I would recommend.

NakedWines	GB	Naked wines personal experience	26 January 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I have become a member of naked wines and I currently deposit a specific amount each month. Firstly the wine I have received and the xmas box has been superb, and I have enjoyed each wine and found them all to be very unique / excellent quality and not like generic supermarket wines. Also as a member I have never been hassled at all to buy more wine as this is something I don't want and would make me cancel my membership. They simply explain when there is very good free wine as part of a 12 bottle purchase. I love the ethos of the company and the fact there is no hard sell. I have now changed my wine buying habits and only buy from naked wines now. I also think the wine is very fairly priced for single vineyard wines. I would and do recommend naked wines to my friends and colleagues.

NakedWines	GB	It’s a luxury, but one worth having!	26 January 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I really can’t fault Naked Wines.  They supply quality wines at reasonable prices, and have a no quibble money back guarantee if you don’t enjoy a particular bottle.The customer service is top notch.  When I first joined I didn’t like 4 wines out of my first order.  I still drank 3 of the bottles (just didn’t particularly enjoy them) and 1 I found undrinkable.  When I spoke to customer service (by email) I said I felt cheeky asking for a refund on all 4 so would still pay for the ones that I drank.  The lady said it doesn’t work that way, if I didn’t fully enjoy the wine then I get a refund, and insisted on reimbursing me for all 4 bottles.  What other company would do that?Over time they have built up a profile of the wines I am likely to enjoy, so I don’t need to ask for a refund very often now.  I am also learning more about wine and appreciate a decent bottle far more than I used to.  It is a luxury - I am now retired so don’t have the income I once did, but it’s a luxury that I enjoy!Highly recommend you give them a try.

The fact that they support independent small growers is brilliant.  As far as I'm aware quite a bit of the wine is grown organically but without the label accreditation so that's very appealing to me.All I really need now is more self discipline when a case arrives!Kind RegardsJoanne

As an angel I get to help wine makers who without our help would be unable to produce the fine wines we enjoy.

This is a win win situation for us tipplers and the small producers alike. May it continue for many years.

They offer a very wide range from £8/bottle to around £50/bottle and everything in between. Together with reservations on special vintages and varied Christmas boxes with goodies thrown in, I'm a happy customer and haven't looked back.

NakedWines	GB	I thought well past the 30 seconds requested…	26 January 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I thought well past the 30 seconds requested on how to rate Naked Wines. I gave 5 stars as wines be offered are always very good, descriptions reasonably accurate, I am always satisfied with value and delivery is fast and reliable. The only factor which caused me taking time to consider the rating is that occasionally I can’t find wines that I am after, recently I was searching for a Brunello without luck. But Naked Wines do not profess to be a supplier of all wines, so it would be unfair for this to be an influencer with my rating. I should also qualify that I do not use all the services that Naked Wines offer but, for what I use, this is a superb service offering great wines for exceptional value.

NakedWines	GB	Naked Wines is a unique concept.	25 January 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Naked Wines is a unique concept that encourages contact between wine producers and consumers. Regular  monthly subscriptions i.e. a steady income enables Naked to effectively fund the production of wines by small producers that  without this help would probably never see the light of day. This new approach has introduced many wines that normally I would never have tried and has broadened my appreciation of wines and grape varieties. Being a member of Naked makes wine drinking a personal rather than an impersonal experience.

NakedWines	GB	Naked Wines covers almost everything!	25 January 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Naked Wines provides a global range of wines at great prices. Becoming a wine angel does tie you to a deposit each month, £30 in my case, but you get this back when you order along with a significant discount on wines of a quality which you can not usually buy for a similar price retail. If you do not like a wine you can get a refund and if a mistake is made in your order the correct wine will be sent and you get to try the mistake and you never know it might be NICE. The views of other customers are available along with percentages of those who would reorder. Delivery is prompt and easy and you can even get to talk with the people who make your favourites. I especially like the free bottles that are often put in your case, are often Magnums, and always very palatable.

There’s a great UK wine-loving community to get involved with as much or as little as you’d like, plus a really genuine, strong support network for the global  independent winemakers, which you can see - and get involved with - at every step of the way, every communication, every bottle of wine, every delivery. It’s pretty impressive and a great network to belong to. Oh and the wines are brilliant too!

NakedWines	GB	Get Naked and enjoy great Wines!	25 January 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I’ve been a client of Naked Wines since last year. I’ve enjoyed great wines, and with the promise that they’ll replace or refund any wine that does not meet my expectations, I’ve not returned any. Not one. And unlike other wine societies Naked prices are competitive and for some wines less expensive. So I’m happy and satisfied and I recommend Naked Wines to everyone. Additionally, I’m a “Naked Angel”; I pay £25/month to Naked, which is credited to my account, and with my agreement, Naked uses the Angels’ fund to finance small wine makers who otherwise would have difficulty in getting to market. In turn those wine makers keep Ángels up to date with their development and occasionally add a free bottle of wine to Ángels’ wine baskets! So I’m enjoying great wines and funding a great cause too. And I can spend or be repaid my Naked account balance any time I choose.You really should join me and become a Naked Angel!

The concept of Naked Wines is great.

The bonus bottles on occasion are brilliant as well. If you like quality wine Naked Wines are a wonderful way to buy them."

In fact, most are very good and the service from the company is excellent. Generally I look for wines between £8-12 which seem very much worth the price tag. I have not seen any of these wines in the supermarkets which makes a nice change! Also, the idea that the growers/producers have (what seems like) a closer connection to Naked Wines and the end users sits well with me...this must be better than having to deal with the buyers from the supermarkets!Cheers, Andrew

An invaluable aspect is knowing the people behind the wines, their story to bring their wines to fruition. This transparent and honest approach helps you to empathize with the growers and makers whose love for their work shines through in their product.I have always liked Naked Wines enthusiasm for helping winemakers through good times and bad.I raise my glass(full one of course) to the ongoing success of the Naked Wines family.

NakedWines	GB	A pleasant experience...........	25 January 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I was a little apprehensive at first because of the cost but after sampling quite a few bottles, cost didn't seem an issue. As the saying goes, you get what you pay for. I've now got a small list of my favourites which I usually stick to. Easy to speak to a member of Naked, which is great in this robot age. Deliveries times are usually good. One delivery got fouled up, delivering to somewhere else, but Naked staff replaced the missing order. All in all a pleasure to do business with!

Their methods to support the smaller wine producers are excellent which creates a perfect harmony between both parties to the benefit of us customers. Naked have never really let me down with service and on the odd occasions that an error occurs they go the extra mile to keep you fully satisfied. Finally and most importantly the wines are top quality, I shall not be going anywhere else.

NakedWines	GB	Highly satisfactory	25 January 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I have been an Angel with Naked Wines for some years and it has been a very satisfactory experience. The web site is very user friendly and informative, the deliveries are reliable and the quality of the wine is good. I do not drink a lot of wine, but when I do, I am fairly discerning and will not drink sub standard wine. The Angel idea is an excellent one, and meets the requirements of good wines at a reasonable price, with the bonus of an odd free bottle thrown in now and again for good measure. These bonus wines are always excellent and one in particular turned out to be an absolute cracker. Just a pity it was all sold out by the time I found out!

Service is always excellent and our regular delivery guy (Warwick, UK, CV34) is just brilliant!NB these wines are not cheap; (they are there to savour not just to glug) but there are often goodies thrown in and in my view the extra quality combined with the convenience makes it worth paying a bit more than we perhaps would in the supermarket.

They are a very customer focussed company - very friendly - and happy to help when things aren't quite as they should be.  I like that they are not pushy; you just buy wines when you want and haven't got them constantly pushing you to buy more. And the other thing is, of course, that they support small vineyards from around the world and are constantly looking for new names to add to their already extensive list.  I think they are great and am really happy to have signed up with them.

Supermarket wines just don't come up to the same standard, unless they are really expensive.Delivery is exactly when they say, so that saves time and energy too. If there are any issues, then the team are very quick at responding appropriately.As part of the wine purchasing you are helping growers to keep doing what they are good at and Zoom visits to wineries is a fun experience.

Friends have raved about Naked for years and I can see why ! Really glad I finally joined up. You can’t go wrong, great choice and a money back guarantee, what’s not to like ?

NakedWines	GB	Useful and appealing	25 January 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Naked Wines operates a very usable web-site with a broad range by country and type. Prices are very reasonable and quality guaranteed, I imagine. They offer most times a nominally free bottle with a complete case, which seems a genuine and mutually agreeable type of promotion; their business model of a small advance subscription off-set against later purchases, intended to benefit producers, is also appealing.

I am in no way a connoisseur but I do enjoy a really good glass of wine, one that you take time to savour.I also like the idea of saving each month to offset the cost of the next selection. However, being an “angel” brings enormous benefits and offers that provide an opportunity to try something different with confidence.

NakedWines	GB	I love being a Naked Wines Angel	25 January 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I love being a Naked Wines Angel. Each month I pay in £30 and when it builds up to enough for a case of wine I go through the wines on offer via my App and make a purchase.I buy cases of 12 red wines which - pandemic restrictions allowing - arrived quickly by courier. Normally Naked Wines add a bonus free bottle as a thank you. Sitting in my cart currently is a £39.99 bottle of craft gin as a thank you for my four years as an Angel.Best of all I’ve never had a bottle of wine that I haven’t enjoyed. Generally they are from small / medium independent vineyards. When we select a bottle for our steak night it is always a delight to read the lovely message from the producers of the wine.I also love the friendliness and expertise of the staff I contact via email or phone. They go out of their way to help in any way you need - even suggesting wines they think I would enjoy based on my preferences.Anyway loved Naked Wines, but don’t tell anyone they are my little secret.

The Pinot Noir Rosé i had with friends the other night, was superb! It is a pleasure not knowing what you will have but it is definitely going to be good!I also like the vibe of the company. They are assertive in pushing their brands but that is because they are working hard for their suppliers and shifting the goods in novel and creative ways.

Not only have I tasted some extraordinary wines, I have also managed to wow my friends at dinner parties.  Shopping for wine has now become a relaxing experience for me, no longer am I found standing in the supermarket peering at the endless selection of bottles and brands.  I am no longer choosing wine based on marketing and price but more on the location and grape.  Each winemaker that appears on Naked Wines has a story to tell.  You are welcomed to their homeland, to their table to sample some of the best flavours they have produced.  They are proud to share their products and I am proud to be a part of it all.

So many absolute gems that are far and away better value than most supermarket offerings. Plus you know you are supporting independent vineyards with great ethics rather than huge multinationals. Good Karma for buying good wine 🍷❤️
NakedWines	GB	Best decision I ever made!	25 January 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I became a wine Angel with trepidation. I didn’t want to be caught up in monthly wine deliveries. I chose how much I wanted to put in each month then l save up till I want any. Every bottle we have had has been fantastic. Highly delighted with the service. No pressure, good comms and excellent wine!

NakedWines	GB	An excellent company	25 January 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	An excellent company! The wines are consistently splendid and, as per their promise, if an occasional bottle is not as hoped, then a refund is applied to your account without question. As it happens only twice across many orders have I needed to do this but not often in today's world will a service promise be applied without question. I can recommend Naked Wines without reservation and it is also good to know that my purchases support independent producers.
NakedWines	GB	Niki’s review	25 January 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I have been a member of Naked Wines for a few months now. My husband and I adore red wine and now order a box of 6 wines every month or 12 bottles occasionally. They are always delicious and it’s exciting to enjoy wines from different vineyards that we normally would not know. The service is excellent and delivery is always very prompt. I would definitely recommend Naked Wines.

So, we are confident in their product, but what about service? Well, again never had any issues there at all. They have evolved their deliveries in line with the logistics market and we get great comms on when and how it will be delivered. They work hard (but not intrusively) to create a social aspect to their service, with direct contact with the wine makers and frequent blogs from them too. So if you like your wine, frequently or occasionally, I would recommend giving these guys a go. Enjoy and cheers!!

NakedWines	GB	Happy ending	25 January 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Made an order of 12 red wine bottles back in December just before Christmas, was very disappointed when I received a complete different order containing only 6 bottles instead.However,  customer service proved to be at the highest quality. After getting in touch about it and expressing my disappointment on the issue, Stanley from customer service took full control of the matter and arranged for both the collection of the wrong case and the delivery of the correct one. Communication was very easy due to very quick responses on every each email I sent to him and the outcome was more than I could have expected considering the busy period; my wines arrived quickly and before Christmas, Stanley made sure of that!People usually are willing to write a negative review but never really take time to write a positive one when their expectations are satisfied.Yes, mistakes happen but that's what customer service is there for and they dealt with efficiently, professionally making clear that they value every each customer as if it's the only one.Need to mention also the wines were spot on.Thank you Stanley and thank you Naked Wines!
NakedWines	GB	Customer service chat does not work	24 January 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Customer service chat does not work. Mininum order of 13 bottles. Informatin is not clear. Payment process did not work and impossible to get someone to help on the chat. Had to try 6 times. And havent fixed it yet.
NakedWines	GB	Stay away!	24 January 2022	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	I couldn’t believe it when I discovered they were using yodel. They are the worst delivery company in the uk. As expected my wine arrived two days late and the create left on my doorstep for all to see/steal. Luckily this was the £20 intro case and not £40 Pinot Grigio. Naked also messed up as I was supposed to get 6 bottles and they only gave me 5! I’d return it and get full refund if they weren’t using yodel to do the collection!!! Cancelling by subscription today. You have been warned!Update 24/1I was contacted by naked wines and offered a £10 account credit which is more then fair. However I have still cancelled by subscription, as yodel are literally the worst delivery company you could use, and i don’t fancy the prospect of a £100 case of wine being delivered late and left sitting on my doorstep unattended! I’ll be back when you use Hermes, dpd or Royal Mail. This has also been pointed out by many other reviews too. Sort it out naked!
NakedWines	GB	Good Website, Mediocre Wine	23 January 2022	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	So the good is that the customer service seems good and the website is engaging. The bad is that the wine is just not very good. If you look at how Naked Wines benchmark their wines and relative pricing it is at times risible, for example, comparing their Antuen Malbec against The Wine Society’s Exhibition Malbec. The WS wines are in a different league. Naked Wines are passable but no better than typical mass market plonk and the claim that their ‘Angels’ system yields material saving is just not credible given the quality.
NakedWines	GB	Great service no quibble guarantee…	22 January 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Great service no quibble guarantee makes choosing different wines easy. Have found some great wines we would never have been able to try
NakedWines	GB	Great service	21 January 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Great service. Very attentive to their customers. If I ever have any issues they’re resolved fast. Also, if my delivery ends up being late (even if it’s because of the postal service) they usually add a bottle to my basket as a kind gesture. Cannot complain. Some great wines too at good prices. The more you use it the better the suggestions because it remembers what you like and recommends similar products. The recommendations have been great so far.
NakedWines	GB	Excellent wines	21 January 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Excellent wines, much better quality than the shop ones, such a great taste at very reasonable prices, the wine connoisseurs will appreciate them, plus always very quick delivery, truly recommend!
NakedWines	GB	Yodel loses Naked another Customer	20 January 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Yodel Guarantees another customer cancels their Account. Wasted two days of my life waiting on yodel to deliver a case of wine. The first fail date, the case didn't leave yodels depot, but I had to wait in all day (well, until late afternoon) before receiving a std email from NW stating that it wasn't going to leave the depot that day.Out of good will I booked a second date (for a few days later) and sacrificed one day from my annual holiday entitlement (big mistake!). The wine didn't leave the depot on that day either and yodels Customer Services just cynically fobbed me off.Naked Wines sent a friendly reply to my emailed complaint suggesting that I consider having orders delivered to a 'collect-plus' location instead!. No explanations were offered to explain the shoddy service, just an expectation that the customer should go out of their way to compensate for NW & Yodels lack of customer care, exonerating yodel of all obligations to perform & ensuring the customer a rather too kafkaesque buying experienceI've enjoyed my time with NW, wines do vary from 'average' to 'superb' and the buying experience (until dispatch) is pleasant. However, with nearly 900,000 Angels you're now (understandably) getting 'Corporate Naked Wines' rather than the more personal experience they previously offered Good bye Naked Wines, I'll be looking for a new wine supplier

Etc. Etc. **Ditto the other reviews here. Buried within smallprint and twaddle I find myself paying stealth tax for a mystery service @£25 each month.

NakedWines	GB	Suprise Account Charges	19 January 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Their convoluted system fails to point out that they will charge you a monthly fee once you sign up. This fact is buried in the mountains of promo material they send you. Had to contact support to delete my account. I'm still waiting for my account to be deleted - meanwhile still recieving marketing materials. Honestly not worth the trouble.
NakedWines	GB	Naked Wines can offer some good wines BUT	19 January 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Naked Wines can offer some good wines at very competitive prices. I was happy to pay into the wine bank and give then £25 per month upfront until I was ready to order a case. The initial problem was with the courier Yodel who I have had dreadful experiences with in the past. They lost my ordered case which I needed for a gathering. I decided to cancel my subscription and asked for a refund leaving them to claim back from Yodel. A whole week later another case was delivered. I reported to Naked wines I had clearly stated that I had cancelled my membership and asked for a refund. They said Yodel would collect the case. I have on 2 occasions left the case to be collected and Yodel can't find their own backside let alone this case. I am still waiting for my refund and if Naked wine continue to use Yodel they will lose a lot more customers. No representative from Naked wines has contacted me to resolve the situation. I have repeatedly requested a refund
NakedWines	GB	All a bit shambolic and expensive	19 January 2022	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	Some excellent wines but very expensive. The average bottle can be found, or a suitable alternative found, easily if you are prepared to shop around. I would caution anyone against ordering ‘rescue’ cases though. These are a farce, you can wait well over a year to receive the wines which leads me to believe you are kept waiting while they try to haggle the cost down and increase their margin. Either way it’s no surprise wineries are struggling if it takes them over a year to ship an already bottled wine.It’s also all a bit shambolic in general, and when coupled with the expense I decided to cancel.
NakedWines	GB	Lovely red wine BUT	18 January 2022	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	Lovely red wine, average IMO whites but each to their own......no what has really angered me is they hide a monthly charge when you sign up and if you dont see their email a month later they will happily take money from you each and every month..............not good enough and far removed from how they act............i detest hidden sales tricks and charges...........

Turns out this company had setup a charge on my account and emailed the wrong email address to let me know this which seems quite dodgy. Had to send several emails and then phone a call centre to get this cancelled, this was not an easy process with excuses about emails, pop up messages and angels given. Ordered a few average wines before Christmas which were also delivered to the wrong street in our town so we had to walk around to find them outside someone else’s house. Would not reccomend or use again.

NakedWines	GB	First purchase	13 January 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	"I have just joined, purely by chance as a result of a voucher from a totally unrelated purchase. The site was extremely easy to navigate and I've received my first case, earlier than expected. Obviously, it would have been rude to not, therefore, try one. Wow! Just wow! If all their wines are of this standard, you are all in for a treat. I look forward to being a long term ""Angel"".I have read reviews where Angel membership seemed to come as a surprise. It was made obvious from the off. I had time to think about it but pre funding my next case makes sense to me. I, too, was a Laithwaites customer for many years. Only once did I ever have reason to return a case and, to this day, they supplied me with my favourite wine of all time; a sparkling Shiraz; I know it sounds like heresy but trust me (can't recall the winemaker). However, that was a one off as I never had the opportunity to buy it, again. Just a heads up, therefore, Naked Wines, if you can find........................"

Needless to say the wines are fabulous, fairly priced and delivered on time even during the pandemic.They do awesome tastings, too, both in-person events (Reading again, please!) and over Zoom using clever post-box friendly sachets - sounds weird but it really works...Recommended.
NakedWines	GB	What a great company	12 January 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	What a great company,  fabulous wine and really helpful customer service,  I did not realise that I had signed up to Angel's (so when £25 was taken from my account) I rang customer service,  and the young lady could not have been more helpful and reassured me that I would get a refund..I will definitely use this company again, the wine was so good..a hassle free way to shop..Well done Naked wines (Angel)

NakedWines	GB	Expected better.	10 January 2022	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	"Just before Christmas, I got a Naked Wines discount voucher so I decided to give it a try. As a Laithwaites customer of many years, I am accustomed to drinking decent wines so I was looking forward to something nice in Naked Wines' introductory case.The wine arrived in good time but I have to say I was very disappointed with the quality. The wines weren't ""off"" but were simply very flat and lacklustre in taste. If this is the kind of standard they use as a carrot to entice new customers, then it didn't work for me. I would have expected something a lot better. Needless to say, subscription cancelled and back to Laithwaites.I suppose if you want mediocre wine at a fairly low price, then this is for you.Update: I read the reply from Karl at Naked Wines (see below) but am declining his generous offer of a refund. As I said, there was nothing wrong with the wine, just not very inspiring. Were I to get a refund and order more wine, I could end up getting free wine for life if this is their normal quality! I would rather pay to have pleasantly drinkable wines."
NakedWines	GB	Watch Out For Dodgy Promotional Offer!	10 January 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	"It seems that Naked Wine went for a promotional offer ahead of the festive period that meant you were unknowingly signed up for some sort of monthly payment of £25.  I see there is another review with the exact same experience.  I did not agree to a monthly payment and this was not made clear when taking up the offer.  Very disappointing to see such an approach taken.  I also tried to find a telephone number on their website but the ""Contact Us"" button doesn't seem to be working but the link to the review site did which meant I found the same issue as I have."
NakedWines	GB	Unauthorised transactions!	10 January 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Bought some wine on 7th December from NakedWines, then they decided to take a FURTHER £25 the following month without my consent. I never signed up for a subscription. My friend also had the same experience. Shocking!
NakedWines	GB	New customers can't buy organic wines	10 January 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	"Very disappointed that almost all of the organic wines were ""Angel Exclusive"" so not available for a new customer to try. Bizarrely one of the wines that is available is described as ""this blend exclusively for our Angels"" so a bit of inconsistency here.  I will get my organic wines from Waitrose Wine Cellar as there is a bigger choice of organic wines and they are happy to welcome new customers"

NakedWines	GB	My Naked Wines experience	09 January 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	HI I have just been reading some of the recent reviews of Naked Wines,  so I thought I would post mine.I have been a member for more than 10 years I have spent South of £13000.00 and couldn't be happier, any issues I have ever had have been dealt with very quickly and professionally. Bottom line the Wines are great, get guzzling.
NakedWines	GB	We were given two vouchers so went to order	09 January 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	We were given two vouchers so went online & ordered wine, entered voucher details, it said “voucher added” but did not discount the price. Obviously, I did not order from them.
NakedWines	GB	The communication is really bad	09 January 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	The communication is really bad. Ordered over 2 weeks ago and I still don’t have confirmation on when they will be delivered even though I selected a date only 3 days after my order date. Bad customer service and will not be using again.

NakedWines	GB	Best way to buy wine	08 January 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Amazing service. Cheaper, better quality and more convenient than going to the store. Access to exclusive wines from independent winemakers who you support. Wine Genie learns the types of wines you like and automates much of the selection process. There is a lot to love here.

NakedWines	GB	Not been part of a wine club before so…	07 January 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Not been part of a wine club before so I can not compare to other clubs.However, having been part of this club for several months now, I find the service very good, helpful and very friendly. The fact that I'm supporting smaller wine makers all over the world by being part of this club, is fantastic and not something I could do by myself. OK, there are cheaper wines in the supermarkets but, generally, the quality of those wines is much less than the wines advertised through the club. A good part of the money you spend on comparable priced wines in the supermarkets, is spend on marketing. This is not the case within NAKED wines. I have only had 25 bottles of wine from the club so far, but I haven't had a bad one yet.
NakedWines	GB	A week appears to be a long time in the…	07 January 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	"A week appears to be a long time in the wine trade !Back on 29 December, I had an exchange of e-Mails about the non-arrival of Wines ordered for delivery before Christmas. Outcome was that Naked Wines agreed to cancel my order and provide a full refund of the £100+ spent - but still delivering the offending wines as an apology. I twice offered them the opportunity to reconsider, but they were adamant.Fast forward to today, with no refund having reached me. It now transpires that Naked Wines DID cancel my original order BUT immediately put through a fresh order for a ""similar"" case, using my account credit to pay for this. Apparently this was considered appropriate as, they say, my original order was not covered by the pre-Christmas delivery guarantee, and I should not have been offered a refund, with or without the ""free gift"" of wines which have now become surplus to requirements.To add insult to injury, it was initially suggested when I was finally able to get through to Customer Services this afternoon, that a refund would be put through AFTER arrangements had been made to collect the belatedly delivered case. On all fairness, this was quickly retracted with Naked Wines agreeing to honour the (entirely unsolicited) promises made to me last week.Bottom line - I just CANNOT trust this organisation any more. Their wines may be pretty decent at the price point, but I can get the same from other sources without the hassle of dealing with an operation that just cannot get it right !"

NakedWines	GB	DO NOT BUY FROM NAKED WINES!!!	06 January 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Placed an order Monday for a box of red wine for a gift for friends. Should of been delivered 5/1/22 I’ve rang today as there’s still no update on order. First Lady left me on hold 20 mins while she tried to see what was going on, got cut off. Rang again st 12.35pm and spoke to Angus who also left me on hold to be told he couldn’t find out what was happening and he’d call me back. Needless to say that never happened either. I then called again and spoke to Sharon who had told me the same she’ll get back to me.Laughable Angus has just called me back to say they will get it sent out again but can’t even give me next day delivery, even though it’s their error. He says he hopes it will be Saturday but I’ve said that’s not acceptable and to tell his supervisor that. Also supervisor will call if they get tome. Absolutely awful company, avoid s all cost. I can see this bring an absolute nightmare.

It’s now the 6th day in a row they have emailed me to say the wine will come the next day, and then it doesn’t. You can’t rely on this company if you need to wine for a certain date. Best to use Virgin Wines.

NakedWines	GB	Save yourself! Worst company ever, with practices similar to scamming!!!	04 January 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Trust me buy anywhere else but forget about them! I have used so far 3 credit cards with them, I have more than 300 pounds blocked/pending that I can't use and i should have received an order today. Not only I do not have the order but when I contacted them they are not able to tell me why I will not receive the order today and when I will receive the order.Their practices are similar to scamming. They block your money, don't deliver, they do not contact you to let you know that you are not going to receive your order and when you contact them they can't provide information as to why you will not get your order or when you will get your order.The absolute worst company to deal with. If you want headaches and your money blocked visit their website, that's all they are good for!
NakedWines	GB	Sickly excuses for not delivering!	04 January 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I ordered for my niece's 21st birthday on the 12th December had to cancel has hadn't arrived by the 20th.. her birthday.After numerous sickly bottomless excuses via email blaming others even though contract is with them a refund was assured on the 22nd in 2 to 5 days.. STILL NOT RECEIVED!I have also had to cancel my debit card as they have taken monies from other customers even after cancelling subscriptions.PARASITES!!!
NakedWines	GB	Sounds good from the start	04 January 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	"Sounds good from the start, the ordering process, app and website is five stars, then the wine arrived, the wine I received was a basic selection and tasted like cheaper supermarket wine. I decided to stick with my other wine company. Although they promote a no subscription service, I found after three weeks, I received an email from nakedwines telling me they were about to take £25 out of my account and place it in an ""angel fund!"" I phoned, I emailed and no reply apart from an automated response. I was able to stop them from taking £25 out of my account but I had to cancel my credit card and reorder a new credit card in order to stop them. So if you've got a lot of time on your hands and you don't mind that kind of hassle then by all means go through the trouble.  I would say stay away and buy from somebody else."
NakedWines	GB	Unreliable is bad enough. Unresponsive is worse	03 January 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	This company is clearly struggling to keep up with its own hype. I've been a subscriber for about four years and all was straightforward until 2021. I placed three orders last year. None arrived on time, and the most time-sensitive one never arrived at all as I ended up cancelling it when it was clear it would arrive AFTER our holiday was over. I have registered a strong objection to what looks like a clear policy to hide customer service phone details from subscribers, when that info should be an absolutely baseline subscriber service. The online presentation of my account is surreally confusing, and It took some determined chasing to get them to refund the non-appearing wine box payment back to my account. Nine months later, my account still shows that sorry incident as an order still being processed.  Both of my recent orders were late -- same old excuse about warehouse problems blah blah. This, just before a marketing email arrives, suggesting I save Xmas embarrassment with a last-minute present delivery from Naked Wines. Ho ho ho. It's clear from other reviews here that NW is in big trouble with its logistics, tech and customer service. My patience has run out and NW will soon have yet another spare Angel slot going begging.
NakedWines	GB	Robbing £25 from you each month without you signing up to it	03 January 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I bought a discounted case of wine last month. At no point was I aware they would start taking £25 out of my bank each month afterwards!! Trickster marketing which was not up front and honest. I can’t even log in on their website because their password reset isn’t working. I want a refund immediately.
NakedWines	GB	Excellent wines at reasonable prices	02 January 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I have been a member (an Angel) for a year now and enjoyed several cases of quality wine. I love the member ratings and descriptions of the wines, that there are many smaller maker choices available and the pricing is great. The service and delivery always seamless.
NakedWines	GB	Never arrived!	02 January 2022	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Ordered red box for £19.99 as it was a great offer from £49.99 with £30 off for new customer. Ordered to be sent to mum's address in time for Christmas. Yodel failed to deliver but would have liked phone call to advise yodel how to get into gated property. So rearranged delivery to my address for later date. Did not arrive. Chased yodel several times and was eventually told day after. Did not arrive. Finally called naked wines who apologised and said it had been lost so would send another case out for next day delivery. Failed to be collected from warehouse. Called naked wines again and cancelled order. Was given £15 credit for next order but lost £30 discount on the original case! To be honest the majority of criticism is for Yodel but disappointed with NW for me having to chase, failed promise, and poor gesture. Cannot comment on the wine as it never arrived.
NakedWines	GB	Great wines, great company	01 January 2022	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I have ordered wine from this company for at least five years and have found them to be excellent and always delivered quickly. I don't order as frequently now but all the recent reviews I have read mostly complained about their delivery not being on time. I think this may be due to the general shortage of lorry drivers affecting all firms at the moment.
NakedWines	GB	company could do a lot better.	31 December 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	wish i had read all these bad reviews before i ordered 12 bottles of mixed wines. they look as if they came of the cheap shelf in a supermarket. ordered 12 mixed. got 5 pairs of the same wine. you have lost another customer.
NakedWines	GB	I would select zero stars if I could	31 December 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I would select zero stars if I could, was promised a box of wines on 20th Dec, ordered on the 18th Dec, received an email on 20th saying it’s delayed, another email 24th saying it won’t be delivered in time for Xmas, absolutely hopeless, thank god I wasn’t relying on these as our festive drinks but they were meant to be a Xmas present none the less. Don’t waste your time and now awaiting a refund 3-5 days.
NakedWines	GB	POOR FROM START TO FINISH	31 December 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I have been a subscriber to NW for a number of years. Placed an order well in advance for delivery early December. Notification was sent to advise the oder had been split into 2 deliveries and delivery date 09 Dec 21. Half the order arrived on 11 Dec. I checked Yodel tracking which stated both deliveries (boxes) arrived in Yodel depot, so I can't understand why they didn't send together. After 9 days and no sign of the other box I contacted NW who advised it must have been lost and they will compensate me for the inconvenience as they were unable to deliver until 29 Dec.NW stated they would refund me for failed delivery and resend free of charge.Yes NW did refund me, however charged me for the reorder. Granted I am not out of pocket, however I have not been compensated for the failed delivery as promised. After a number of phone calls to NW and email ping-pong and getting nowhere whatsoever I cancelled my subscription after getting fed up of numerous attempts to explain basic mathematics.After looking at many recent reviews it seems a coincidence that Yodel keep failing to deliver or losing large cases of wine, I was told my missing case was scanned into their warehouse but never scanned out, I wonder where all these boxes of wine are!!!! From my personal experience of customer service at NW and a complete shambles of a deliver service (Yodel) I would avoid.

We loved the first virtual wine tasting over covid times 👌😀
NakedWines	GB	Very poor customer service	29 December 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Ordered  a case of wine as a leaving gift for my MD for delivery before Christmas and as a trial for Naked Wines to become our supplier for our Xmas Wines for staff and  customers. The wine was NOT delivered although I was given the date of December 22nd. Rang them to see if the wine would be delivered before the 24th and was told that this could not be guaranteed therefore cancelled the order. I was told I would get a refund in 3-5 days. I have been recieving emails updating me on my cancelled order so rang again today. The order hadn't been cancelled so I have to wait  a further 3-5 working days for a refund which is unacceptable. Asked to speak to manager and the response was someone will contact me in a few days as they are really busy making calls that just proves the service you get from Naked wines is very very poor if the management team are having to resolve customer issues and cannot call a customer back for few days.I order approx 50-70 cases per annum   (from different suppliers) but with this extremely low level of customer and delivery service I will never use Naked wines again. My advice would be avoidUPDATE:True to their word Georgina did call me back and while my faith has not been restored as yet in Naked Wines she was very sympathetic to my complaint and understood completely the reasoning behind this. I hope that all the comments we discussed will be passed to her management team and they can improve the service which is seriously lacking at this moment in time. Georgia was an absolute pleasure to deal with and speak to even though she was suffering with covid. Thank you for your time, patience and understanding.
NakedWines	GB	Avoid at all costs take your money when account cancelled !!!	28 December 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Second review: despite being told that my account was closed 12th December 2021 and then receiving a confirmation  email on 14th December which stated no further funds would be taken from my account, On 20th December Naked wines took £103.86 was from my bank account on the 20th December. I also received yodel tracking for this cancelled  order which was strange as it appeared this order had been back and forth between Naked and yodel bristol at least twice, suffice to say I never received the order. I will give them 14 days to refund me or will take legal action against this appalling company, please avoid at all costs.

NakedWines	GB	Used a discount voucher	27 December 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Used a discount voucher . Ordered my husband a box of 6 red wine.  He loves red wine but found each bottle undrinkable and bitter/sharp in taste . I'm very disappointed as this gift was a Xmas gift from me . All bottles now open and still full . Will not order again . Feel like they sent all the rubbish that no body bought .

Impossible to remove card details.
NakedWines	GB	Can't deliver when they promise - don't use these amateurs	26 December 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I ordered on 15 Dec 6 bottles for my sister's Christmas, to be delivered on the 23rd. They failed to deliver, and sent an email with excuses and promising delivery on the 24th. Same on the 24th with another email with a different excuse saying delivery would now not be before Christmas. I live in Aberdeenshire, my sister lives in Bournemouth. How was I supposed to  order alternative wines mid afternoon on Christmas Eve. They left us in the lurch on Christmas Eve with no suggestions or ideas that might help me, or even an offer to cancel if I wanted !!! As of 26th still no sign of the wine, so I've emailed them cancelling the order. These people have buggered off for Christmas and to hell with their customers - (I see another review confirming they have done this to at least one other customer as well.) Don't buy from these amateurs. PS - I noticed in other reviews that they are deducting money monthly from some people as a kind of subscription. So I found the email confirming my one off order. Surprise, surprise they intend taking £25 from me every month. They seemed to have learnt a thing or two from Amazon Prime. These guys are not just useless at customer service, they are also basically dishonest - be warned.

NakedWines	GB	Good wines and value for money.	25 December 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I have been with Naked Wines for a few months now and found them to be fantastic.   The wines are great quality and offer an amazing variety.  For me delivery has always been good and in time, though I note many have had issues around this time of year, but I did not.    I have never had a bad wine yet and often follow recommendations that feed via the app, based on my feedback.Overall, I would recommend. Decent price, excellent wine and you get to interact a little with the winemakers via the website should you choose.

NakedWines	GB	Failed Delivery Again!!!!	24 December 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Ordered in plenty time for Xmas and delivery should have been 23rd , then after contacting customer service was told it was coming 24th . Just had an email at 4pm to say it's not coming.  How the hell am I supposed to make alternative arrangements for Xmas day and Boxing day at such short notice. Didn't stop them sending countless messages about how wonderful their wines are, dreadful customer service. Don't use them.
NakedWines	GB	Failed Christmas delivery	24 December 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Ordered wine on 16 December as part of a Naked Wine Christmas promotion and now discover it won’t arrive until 29 December. To rub salt into the wound I received an email from NW yesterday extolling the  virtues of the delicious magnum of complimentary wine I was about to receive the next day. Sadly it will be another six days, at the earliest, for it to arrive. I have also received other emails this week from NW with offers of wonderful wines before Christmas. Too many false promises and over zealous marketing methinks.

NakedWines	GB	False promises of delivery	24 December 2021	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	Found it really difficult to know how to cancel my subscription as there’s no info on the app or advice as to how to do it.Used my final “angel” balance up as THEY emailed ME to say if I ordered that day, I’d receive the case by Dec 24th. Received an email on the 23rd to say that was unlikely to happen.Wines are ok, but you can get just as nice for better prices in the supermarket. I’m gutted they’ve taken all that money and. It even offered a refund when we won’t get any of the bottles we wants for Xmas day or Boxing Day. Not good enough.

NakedWines	GB	Still waiting for a 24th November order	24 December 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I ordered mine on 24th November. Many false promises of delivery before Xmas. Still waiting ... not even received by Yodel yet, after something happened to the previous attempt at getting it from the warehouse to me (damage by Yodel?). Previous experience has been good but something has obviously happened. Will not be using them again.
NakedWines	GB	Delivery date porkies	24 December 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I ordered 24 wines from their luxury offer as the delivery was guaranteed before Christmas. I then received an email stating they 'plan to deliver my cases on the 24th December', fair enough, that is in time for Christmas. We'll it is now the 24th and I've had no text or email other mailshots from some of their suppliers so I've got the tracking information which says the order is at Warrington and will deliver on the 29th. The exact same for my pal who ordered before me and 2 days ago was also told the 29th.Completely misleading, no word from them to say there would be a delay, terrible service.
NakedWines	GB	Absolutely Terrible	24 December 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Terrible experience. I’ll be cancelling my subscription. Ordered £200 of wine on Dec 1st and when they didn’t arrive on expected date, I had to chase them up. Apparently Yodel damaged both boxes of wine, not that anyone informed me for 2 weeks. I then had to reorder as wines were out of stock. On the 24th Dec I’m told my wines won’t be here for Christmas so I should make other arrangements. Appalling service and an absolute shambles with the delivery service.
NakedWines	GB	Atrocious. Despatch and delivery a joke	24 December 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Ordered wine on 15th December. Expected delivery date 23rd December.When I checked the Yodel website on 23rd it said they hadn't received the wine yet. Called Naked wines who said it was a problem with the Yodel website. My wines were with Yodel for delivery.An hour later, an email from Naked Wines saying there had been a mechanical problem which had affected despatch. They were still working to get the order to me before Saturday (25th).This evening (23rd) I checked the Yodel website. Now they have the order, expected delivery 29th December. That's no good to me.I've been let down on many occasions now, either by Naked Wines not despatching in time, or failed Yodel deliveries.Atrocious way to run a business. I'll be cancelling my membership and I'd advise others to stay well clear of them.Update 24th December - Yodel employ a driver who knows what they are doing, and can find addresses! Website today (24th) said out for delivery. The wines were indeed delivered today. The driver said it wasn't due today, but he thought I might need it!
NakedWines	GB	Yodel….enough said	23 December 2021	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	I waited 10 days for a delivery. Then I noticed it hadn’t been dispatched. Having contacted the office, they said they would make sure it was sent and that Yodel would deliver quickly. I asked them why they were depending on Yodel, given their awful reputation! And guess what? Next day, Yodel said the case would arrive between 14.03 and 16.03…which of course it didn’t. Then their website said that it had been “handed to the customer” at 19.22, except it hadn’t. I had been sitting working at my desk overlooking the front door all evening, and I have a Ring Video doorbell, so can see that no-one came to the door. Naked Wine will loose my business because they insist on using the worst courier company in the country.Update: Naked Wines did as they promised, and delivered more wine. They fulfilled their promise, and more importantly went out of their way to fix the problem. I have reinforced my view that NW should not continue using Yodel, as it will damage their brand. Thank you Naked Wines for your help. But please use a decent carrier.
NakedWines	GB	Great wine, terrible delivery…	23 December 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	While I was very pleased to receive my order a day earlier than originally planned, I was very disappointed indeed by the delivery itself. We have an enclosed front porch, which was unlocked today when the delivery arrived, although we were not at home. The delivery driver would have had to enter the porch to ring the doorbell. Our instructions for delivery were to leave in a safe place if there was no answer. Leaving the case inside the porch would have protected it from the weather and also put it out of sight; it was in fact left out in the open, on the drive, outside the (unlocked) porch door, in full view from the road and at the mercy of the weather. As the case of wine has a value of well over £100, such poor care of the case is, in my opinion, unacceptable.The wines were, in fact, undamaged and I hope that we will enjoy them. However, if this poor standard of security with delivery is typical, we are disinclined to purchase from Naked Wines again in future. This is very different from our experience with the Wine Society, whom we use regularly for delivery and who always leave our wine safely and securely.

To make matters worse still receiving messages to order wine for a guaranteed xmas delivery !! Shocking way to do Business !!
NakedWines	GB	Shocking experience	23 December 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Shocking experience, waited over a week for the order to be delivered. Various excuses used warehouse issue/delivery problems. Had family up for a gathering and due to the issues had to buy more wine, and wait for a refund. Felt like they didn’t want to honour my joining discount tbh, had no intention of delivering the order. Never again
NakedWines	GB	What a shambles!	23 December 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	What a shambles! Two separate orders placed in December - one early December that failed to be fulfilled as they said the courier company they used had gone bust. They didn't tell us or reach out - we found out by chasing/following it up. Second order placed in December was told it would be delivered on 23rd December so in time for Christmas and have since found it won't be delivered until 29th so after Christmas. What a dreadful way to do business. My added concern is others are being told of machine breakdowns, delivery issues, staffing issues - so which is it? Be honest with your customers and start doing business properly. This is how businesses fail. Both my husband and I are seriously considering going elsewhere. What a shame given so many small winemakers with amazing wine and expectations are banking on Naked Wines to 'deliver the goods'!

NakedWines	GB	Let down!	23 December 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	"I placed my order on the 14th Dec. 2021 and was advised that my wine would be delivered on the 23rd Dec - this was longer lead time that usual but I understand that it's a very busy time of year.  I did not receive any of the usual SMS / email updates, so I decided to contact Customer Services. I was then  advised that there was a problem with a machine in the warehouse (which happened a week ago), which has resulted in delays to orders ... and no delivery date could be guaranteed.I accept that things breakdown, however I'm very disappointed that Naked Wines chose not to inform their customers and manage their expectations ... and I now have no wine for Christmas!  I think it's time to reconsider this membership - I'm certainly not being treated like an ""Angel""."

Nothing arrived so I contacted their customer service. The money had come out but I had no confirmation emails or anything like that so they used my postcode to locate the order. I then immediately got an email confirmation saying delivery for the 29th December and the guy said that I had selected the 29th and he couldn't rush the order, even though there was still 2 full days before Christmas. I had selected delivery for the 22nd a took a day off work to accept the delivery. Now not only do I have no wine for Christmas but I also missed out on a day worth of pay. Absolutely shambolic customer service, never using them again. Avoid at all costs. I expect I'll now get a reply saying ""So sorry for the confusion, we'll work on this to make sure it never happens again."" But looking at the reviews it clearly won't be fixed, and my Christmas is now without vino. What a load of rubbish!"

NakedWines	GB	Been a member for many years..	22 December 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Been a member for many years.WAS AN ANGEL.. MOT ANY MORE. At the beging Nov 21 I recived a wine hamper and my account & credit card was debited for £184, when I contacted NW I was told I had ticked a box last year to order a hamper this year, If I did I didnt mean to and I didnt want the hamper. I was told the wine would be collected and acounts credited. some weeks later I emaied to say I was still waiting. I was again told the collection would be arranged and accounts credited. Many emails have been sent since.I then ordered another box of wine for Christmas (what a mug)delivery was down for the 20th Dec, today is the 22nd no wine has been delivered. I now have a box of wine I dont want, I dont have a box of wine I did want and the whole experiance leaves me out of pocket over £300.  I cant get to talk to a humanbeing who will take ownership of the situation and sort it out.
NakedWines	GB	Case not delivered	22 December 2021	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	Like so many, I ordered a case on the 6th December, it made it to the Yodel Depot on the 14th - now, 22nd December, no sign of it.Called NW a couple of times, promised a return call - nothing.Been a customer for a few years, and I know carriers are a law to themselves, but I expect better customer service.Told NW that if the case wasn’t going to arrive before Christmas, then cancel it and I will make a new selection. Looked at my account today and it’s down for delivery 5/1/22 - obviously don’t listen and despite promises no one has contacted me.To add insult to injury, got an email saying how best to enjoy my case of wines this Christmas - think they are taking the mickey (not allowed to say pxxs).Well done NW for pulling out the stops and getting my case delivered before Xmas.Upgraded to 3 starts, would have been higher if the individuals who promised to call back actually did.I know the supply chain at the moment is a disaster, but I ensure my sales team keep communicating, even if its bad news, its better than silence.Wines, as always, very good - though Jan is my detox month, so will have to wait a few weeks to drink the remaining bottles :)

I have no plans to spend £25.00 a month on wine - this box was for other people. I see many are having delivery issues, it's known there have been supply issues and shares have dropped but hey! it's happening in a lot of places.

NakedWines	GB	What a joke	20 December 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	What a joke. 19.99 for 6 bottles of crap. Wasn't too bothered until I had been put into some silly angel gang and would be paying 25 a month. Was delivered on the wrong day, luckily I had popped home....went to leave and the wine had been left on my doorstep without a knock. The delivery driver legging it without a look back. GUYS, SAVE YOUR MONEY FOR BETTER CUSTOMER HONEST INFORMATION AND LEAVE OUT THE MISLEADING POSTCARDS. Better wine at the supermarket, at least they don't lie.
NakedWines	GB	This was my second time as an Angel	20 December 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	This was my second time as an Angel? With this company and why did I bother. My Christmas gift order after 8 days is still sitting in the Yodel depot. Three people at Naked all tell you how sorry they are and they will get onto Yodel and let me know what’s happening. NOTHING! No phone call , email, text. I left them last time after waiting two weeks for an order and I should have expected that a culture like that never changes.I’ll try The Wine Society or Laithwaites.
NakedWines	GB	Didn't deliver - Didn’t apologise	20 December 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Never delivered. After chasing myself, I was told the order was put on hold because they need to verify large (+£200) orders by phone - prior to that, no contact was made, despite ordering 1 month prior to xmas.  After chasing, it was claimed additional verifying checks were needed, no actual checks where done as my account as fully up to date, including a phone number in which they could have rung me themselves. They offered me a new delivery slot 24 days later (30th December - after Xmas) .  No apology or attempt to truly rectify the situation, only claiming the process had failed!! I have since cancelled my order, my angel subscription and any future dealings with this company.  Reading apology responses on trustpilot I can see they don’t take this seriously, only joking/excusing and repeating statements like “have requested some additional information via your Trust Pilot account“.

NakedWines	GB	Scammed	19 December 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Cashed in a voucher which came in the post for some discounted wine. Was signed up for the 'Angel Club' and unwittingly began paying £25/month. Reading the comments of others it is clearly commonplace that people are signing up/paying this subscription without realising and the agreement is obviously misleading. Also, Naked Wines have responded to many of these messages, so they know this is happening and continue the practice regardless.

NakedWines	GB	Chaotic service	19 December 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Really poor service following a warehouse ‘upgrade’, the promised next day delivery did not happen and a week later I was still waiting for a delivery date.  This was compounded by a poor communication strategy which consisted of 2 ‘jokey’ emails saying that they were having difficulties but with no resolution plan and only a limited apology.  When I cancelled the order, I am disappointed to note that a further 10 days after this I have not been refunded the cost of the case.

They  lose wines lie repeatedly to customers that they tried to deliver but you were out ( when you’re waiting at home ) them lie about leaving a card - looking at naked wines Facebook page this is sadly a very common story - I would avoid  at all costs I’m just hoping that I get a refund or delivery before Christmas as I’m now worried the company may be in financial trouble

NakedWines	GB	Updated - Absolutely abysmal service	17 December 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Absolutely abysmal service. Ordered 2nd December and no sign of delivery on 17th. Original delivery estimate was 7th. Supposed to be a pre Christmas tipple gift but got stuck at “local depot” wouldn’t even allow me to collect in person. Avoid this supplier like the plague. Go to the supermarket instead. I’d like to update the the response from Naked Wines is a complete fabrication as well as I never received any wine from them. Even more reasons to avoid as they are quite clearly dishonest as well. I demanded a refund in the end.

They then sent me a voucher which I tried to use for Xmas wine and when I went to use it the computer  said I’d already had one and it wasn’t valid. Probably easier just picking a few cases up somewhere else.
NakedWines	GB	6 missing deliveries and still no wine	17 December 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	My wife and I both signed up to Naked Wines using a voucher offering a decent discount, and after making our selections we were very excited about receiving our wine. Unfortunately, 6 delivery attempts between us later (4 of which required signatures), numerous emails and calls to both Naked & Yodel, and a total of 63 missing bottles, we have both had to cancel our subscriptions. Naked's delivery service are either stealing the orders or are too incompetent to find our house when given the address (you'd think this was a basic requirement for a courier service). We even asked if they could use a different courier service but that was not possible. Really disappointing, and although everyone on the Naked Wines side were extremely helpful, I cant give them anymore than 1 star if they cant actually get the product to the customer.
NakedWines	GB	Easy to order	17 December 2021	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	Easy to order, with a good discount.  Not yet delivered so cannot comment on that yet.Further to this review - promised delivery date was not met. Eventually delivered before Christmas after lots of emails. Will not use again.
NakedWines	GB	Very Misleading Voucher - Sort it out naked wines	17 December 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	"I received a voucher for £75 off a case of wine (12 bottles) worth £114.99 or more. The voucher stipulates ""NO requirement to join any wine ""clubs"". However it is very very misleading as by using the voucher; you are indeed signing up to their ""Angel Club"" where they take money from your account each month to put into an account towards future orders.It does not say that on the voucher. I am not saying that this Angel club isn't good for those looking for a wine club - what I'm saying is that the voucher is misleading and if you proceed with the order, you will automatically be added to their Angel Club and debited each month. I just wanted a one time purchase as a gift as per the details on the voucher. I got as far as the checkout then contacted them to double check... that's when they mentioned the club.. so I didn't proceed with the order. It doesn't mention it on the checkout details either. FAO Naked wines - Just be transparent. ""Claim £75 off your case of wine when you join our Angel Club"" ... there, I fixed it for you! I'm sure there are people who actually want to join wine clubs."

NakedWines	GB	Let down badly, cancelling account	16 December 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Sadly let down badly. We are new customers and have had 2 cases delivered successfully to our new address. A 3rd got delayed in the warehouse. Numerous automated messages saying sorry and how much they care and the wine will be worth it. Eventually shipped and lost by their courier, no effort to hold the courier to task just told to look at the automated tracking (which just says need more info but you can’t contact them). Replacement case ordered but told delivery will now be 23rd Dec and no guarantee it will actually be here before Christmas. Doesn’t feel like they really care about resolving an error quickly, have just been added back in to the sausage machine and told they have to use the same courier. Bad experience. Have cancelled our account and will source another supplier who deals with errors in a speedy and caring way. Shame, this could have been a positive resolution.

NakedWines	GB	Great when they started but ...	16 December 2021	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	Great when they started, I've been a member for several years. Originally, decent 'cheap' wines, Red n White. More recently, IMHO, the quality of the white wines have gone downhill - for example my local Tesco has better quality and priced Whites than NW. I've never had a problem with delivery, for me the main issue is the deterioration in white wine quality vs cost. And as one final gripe - the 'throw in's' - I don't want 1.5 l of Red as a 'gift', or olive oil or Gin for that matter - I would prefer that so called saving to be translated into making available the best quality whites at the best price. That is after all what you set out to do ...

NakedWines	GB	Cancelled today because of poor service	16 December 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I have today cancelled my account with Naked after over 7 Years of great wines and excellent service. Its just not the same company - Granted I am unable to comment on the wine quality as they never actually arrived. Was really looking forward to the 2 Gavi's I had ordered but after 3 failed attempts at delivery and some poor excuses for the service failure, I am going to use Majestic and my local wine shops instead. To be honest we should all be shopping local but giving new suppliers a chance seemed a great idea.Some free advice from someone who works with service operation analysis - research the concept of service recovery, in particular the justice needs of customers and you might notice customers are less forgiving of poor service than a poor product. Would I recommend you - sadly not.The phone call I had from customer service was polite and apologetic. With individuals I have no issues, but the promises sadly turned out to be empty ones A good concept and product, failed by poor delivery systems and insincere customer service emails.
NakedWines	GB	Deliveries always a nightmare	15 December 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	The Naked Wines product is great, but unfortunately their delivery partners Yodel are a total nightmare and Naked do nothing to help. My last delivery was achieved only with the exchange of multiple emails and multiple delivery days where Yodel didn’t show up. I currently have a case out which was due to be delivered on Monday and Yodel tracking still says it’s being delivered yesterday between 3pm and 5pm. Naked Wines only allow you to chat using a dysfunctional chat bot and a customer service line that isn’t staffed. I’ve just cancelled my subscription, but am out of pocket significantly from the missing case of wine. Hopeless.

NakedWines	GB	Wine/ concept fab - plummeting customer service/delivery	14 December 2021	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	"I would give the concept, and the wines themselves 5* but the service and delivery recently 1* so have met in the middle!!When I joined Naked wines, there was a waiting list to become an Angel, I imagine to keep things small, personal, and the service exceptional. I signed up, and waited. Once I was in it was fab. Great unusual wines, easy to pay a bit each month, and order as and when, fabulous customer service (not that anything ever seemed to go wrong then, but wines were delivered ON TIME, and the one issue I had was resolved super quickly and efficiently. I didn't even mind the ""spam"" email's as they were often interesting) on the ball deliveries - HAPPY days.For the past year or so the service has plummeted (did that coincide with Eamon leaving?) drastically, to the point it seems Angels are leaving in their droves (if the reviews on here are anything to go by!!).Twice now a case has been ""damaged"", twice now the wrong wine has/will be sent (yes instead of 2 bottles of Rose, 2 bottles of sherry will do ???!!!) and now I have the added value of them telling me when my ""damaged wines"" will be sent, 20th Dec, only to be told that no, actually they are delayed with the courier...... when I asked customer service they said they had no idea what was going on as the wines hadn't left the warehouse yet!!  I only order about 4 times a year, so that's a high rate of getting it wrong/there being an issue. Will I see them in time for Christmas? that's anyone's guess.If the problem truly is with the delivery company being useless, for the love of god Naked wines, change delivery company!!! Personally I feel Naked has grown to big to provide the level of service it used to, which is a crying shame, as it was brilliant. It seems I am not the only disgruntled Angel  going on recent reviews!!UPDATE: If it was just this one occasion, this review would not be happening, my wines were delivered, not on the date you said they would be but hey..... I also somehow received an apologetic email stating that you were not going to get them to me by Christmas - more mistakes. Sadly friends who I recommended to you guys received an email at 11.53PM on Christmas eve to say they were not going to get their wine before Christmas - which is absolutely shocking, as 1) they had no time to make other arrangements and 2) were actually isolating with COVID. They have since cancelled their account, as have I."

So far had useless webchat contact, asking me to go around and ask every neighbour.EDIT (the following day) : the delivery had been made to a wrong address. Neither the courier nor Naked Wine inform me of this, it was the person who received the delivery by mistake who rang me today and I could receive the order eventually. A mistake in the delivery, and a thank you to the honest neighbour. Reviewed the rating based on good customer contact received (over the phone in the UK).

NakedWines	GB	Don’t waste your money. Bad service	13 December 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Ok so was a Naked angel but what with getting wrong orders, I only drink white and they sent red, and bad customer service I cancelled my subscription in June.  Since then I have had money deducted from my bank account and wine cases sent.  I have emailed and called numerous times and each time I am told it is sorted. Nope.  Tried sending another case this month.  Tried blaming me. I would not recommend this to anybody.
NakedWines	GB	Doesn't deliver	13 December 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Oh dear. I have been a Naked Wines customer for about a year or so, a fully subscribed Angel no less. The fundamental problem is with delivery: every time we order there's a problem. Contact customer services and we have lots of excuses (staff shortages, broken lift), but no-one willing to do anything to actually help. It shouldn't be difficult, but sadly, it seems a stretch too far for Naked. I have cancelled my Angel sub and will be going elsewhere.
NakedWines	GB	Still waiting for my delivery 10 days…	13 December 2021	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	Still waiting for my delivery 10 days after it was due, for a company that automatically adds you to the wings scheme, I would at least expect orders to be out on time ( even a day or 2 late isn't all that bad ) but for it to go over a week and still not have left the warehouse is really bad. Not the best first impression.
NakedWines	GB	Empty promises	13 December 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I ordered a case of wine for the first time from Naked Wines on 26/11/21 on was told it would be delivered on 29th - not delivered. Then received email saying it would be next day - not delivered. This continued the next day and the next. By this time I had had enough, requested a refund and unsubscribed. The response was another email saying it was on its way. Received email Saturday stating due to my experience £10 had been added to my Naked Wines account (which was now closed) and the wine would be delivered that afternoon - not delivered. Sunday another email saying it would be delivered that day between 13:26 & 15:26 - not delivered. Just want my money refunded which they were quick enough to take out of my account.
NakedWines	GB	Excellent service ,wines always good.	13 December 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Excellent service ,wines always good.Last week I decided to leave above ,had been paying in £20 a month. Process of leaving so easy and they refunded my credit very quickly.
NakedWines	GB	Carpet bomb of junk emails!	13 December 2021	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	They were ok for wine, but have you tried unsubscribing from their junk emails.
NakedWines	GB	Complete failure	12 December 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I ordered in good faith quite awhile ago and all seemed to be well especially as told it was on its way for Saturday...... then late on the day a message apologising that my order had missed the trailer (whatever that may be!!) and would sent asap. On Monday received another note stating on its way followed later by another 'apology' saying it had missed the trailer again. Wednesday told on its way to arrive between 1532 and 1732 and tracked with Yodel. Checked the tracking number at 1540 which said Yodel were only 10 doors away from my house and he had 7 more drops before me. 30 mionutes later I checked again to find he was still where he had been and still with 7 deliveries before me!! Checked again an hour later and then 90 mins later and still same answer!! Nothing arrived so next day complained to Naked wines who apologised and said they would check. They came back and said order on its way!! Nothing arrived so complained again and told arriving Wednesday....... nothing did. Tried complaining to Yodel and all I got was to have patience as it was on its way!! Complained again to NW and told late on Friday that it was on its way and arriving between 1530 and 1730 which was strange as that message did not arrive until after 2100 that evening!! needless to say still no arrival that day or the next!! How on earth do you get a responsible correct answer and even more a promised delivery????
NakedWines	GB	Ridiculous lead times and decreasing quality	12 December 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	After being a naked wine customer for years and even upping my monthly subscription I have finally had enough. Over the last 12 months I have noticed less of the wines I love (Meursault, Montrachet, Montagny) and lead times just getting ridiculous! My recent order placed I was quoted 8 days delivery - then I receive an email stating the are having a few problems and can’t confirm when I might get my wine - bye bye Naked!!_So just a quick update ordered 7th Dec, quoted delivery 16th Dec, now it is 17th Dec and still no delivery!
NakedWines	GB	Order not received. No updates	12 December 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Placed my order for Saturday delicery. Received an email from Naked stating they had a mechanical issue with the wine picker which was causing a delay. I have not received any further updates and now left wondering when this parcel will arrive. Could this be a case of Naked not being able to cope with the demand. Come on Naked pull your finger out customer service guys and provide better, clearer updates, I will be cancelling my membership before my next payment is due as I will be returning to Magestic for my wine. This disappointed angel is flying away.
NakedWines	GB	This makes perfect sense	11 December 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	This makes perfect sense - I keep my balance until the end of the year and Christmas is sorted - good communication from the team and regular updates on producers and wines - you don't get that from your local wine shop.
NakedWines	GB	Good wines, appalling customer service	11 December 2021	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	Good wines appalling customer service! I have been to get a refund for weeks now. Very slow communication and you have to explain yourself every time you contact. I have never before have to struggle as much as I have to get my money back. Disappointing!!Charles
NakedWines	GB	Never Again	11 December 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	"Never AgainAny wine club rests on three main ""legs"" 1. Wine at a reasonable price. 2 A working communication with the clients. 3 Good logistics. At Naked wines, the two latter is a disaster. How the wines are, I do not know, since they never reached me. What I do know, is that this is a company that I should not have trusted in the first place. When the wine I paid for did not arrive as promised, I started chasing customer ""service"". Who on their behalf told me to rest assured they were working very hard to solve the problem. The first lie, confirmed by the delivery company who had not been contacted at all about the missing delivery. So instead of actually trying to solve the problem, the lies continued, now about the weather. What a desperate lie, when you sit in a completely different part of the country. We who were here never had a problem, just a few drops of rain. Then when one lie after another was exposed and there was nowhere left to run. Then up from the hat comes a new trick about technical problems in the warehouse, that might be true. But I still do not have the wine I paid for. In the end, I asked them to cancel my order. Then one from customer ""service"" sent me a mail ""hoping I enjoyed my wine"".  Hours of frustration of chasing the wine, they ""were working so hard"" to bring me. I never got any wine, but more lies and excuses that any serious company would be ashamed of. I have still not seen any refund or wine they promised."
NakedWines	GB	Very disappointed that my first order…	10 December 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Very disappointed that my first order arrived late, and completely wrong. I ordered test drive reds case of 12. It was meant to arrive yesterday, but didn't. I received a notification that it would arrive today and was looking forward to trying some new red wines. The yodel driver handed me a small box, clearly not 12 bottles. I had received 3 bottles of red, and 3 bottles of white! I don't even drink white wine! It's clearly not a good sign when your first order can't even be sent correctly. To be fair Suzanna from live chat was helpful, but I've now to parcel up the box, wait 3 days for yodel to collect it. And then my initial order will be replaced by customer services! So I'll be lucky to get my wine by Christmas. Overall a very poor first experience with this company.
NakedWines	GB	Awful Excuses	10 December 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	"I am appalled that you are charged to pick a delivery date. To then just after cancelling a membership you get automatically entered into that you don't want. That there's ""mechanical issue"" in the warehouse so you will get delivery on another date. Where is the offer of a refund for delivery? There isn't. I'm sure even with the issue at the warehouse. Staff still get to enjoy a glass on their desk"

NakedWines	GB	Delivery is appalling	10 December 2021	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	I was rather enjoying the concept of Naked Wines. I don't really miss the monthly money and then order a selection of decent wines for a decent price. My problem is the delivery (as others have said). Absolutely atrocious in terms of how long it takes the parcel to arrive. I was told mine would come 5 days after the order (which is fine) but sat in all day twice and no order. My current order is sat at the local delivery warehouse and has been for 3 days so 8 days on from my order and money being taken from my account. I'm afraid I am looking to leave if they don't change the delivery as it is just not worth it sitting in every day expecting the delivery (which is large and expensive to leave outside or with a neighbour) and just no show!
NakedWines	GB	Yet again you have short changed me	10 December 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Yet again you have short changed me! No olive oil or vinegar in the Christmas case as purchased. This is the 3rd time you have not sent the full order ie. Multiple bottles short. Interestingly you didn't forget to add the tag to encourage others to join! This is clearly systematic given the occurances. Are you anticipating people will not check their orders? Please refund the value to my bank account and cancel my subscription with Naked Wine. I will be taking this further. You deserve to be 'called out' on trust pilot etc. I suspect this isn't an unfortunate coincidence. Shame on you Naked Wine!!!
NakedWines	GB	Now an unreliable service	09 December 2021	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	Used to be a quality all round service, but recently the delivery side of the business has become so unreliable it’s not worth keeping my membership.The Naked Wines staff have always been really friendly and a great asset to the business, but someone there has decided that their delivery partner is good enough for their customers - which it isn’t. Regrettably, will be cancelling my membership after 10 years.
NakedWines	GB	Well I have £126 stored but cannot…	09 December 2021	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	Well I have £126 stored but cannot order because they keep insisting on including red wine as the gift.  Firstly we don't ever drink red, secondly turkey and red wine is not something we would offer guests.  So WHY no choice
NakedWines	GB	Wine is OK, Yodel delivery sucks	09 December 2021	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	Although most of the wines I've had from Naked have been OK - not great, but OK - the Yodel delivery absolutely sucks. Today, my £150 order has gone missing. Yodel don't care. To be fair, Naked have promised a refund and I can see that on my account, so 4 stars for them. But their business is being let down by a joke of a delivery company whose behaviour can best be summed up as criminal. Zero stars for Yodel.

NakedWines	GB	DONT USE THIS COMPANY	08 December 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Once again I receive a mailing from Naked Wines where they clearly say FREE DELIVERY.To gain the Free Delivery on the offer, you have to register on their site which commits the potential buyer to the T&Cs of their second rate product (the product is not the actual wine, it is the company's service).If you look at their T&Cs then Free Delivery only applies on orders over £100.00. So the clear implication of FREE DELIVERY on all orders DOES  NOT EXIST.In the mailing they reference that they don't have SNEAKY SMALL PRINT CATCHES. Clearly this is not true as per the the T&Cs referred to above.Clearly they think they're being clever but all they're doing is showing themselves being completely disingenuous and lacking transparency.No doubt I'll get a response from someone in the Naked Wines team, stating that what I'm stating is incorrect and how sorry they are. PLEASE DON'T BOTHER as you'll be wasting your time and mine. Far better you just change your mailings to actually reflect the truth -It is so easy to tell the truth instead of hiding away from it!ALL you need do re 'FREE DELIVERY' is check your own T&Cs where it states the order has to be over £100.00People tell me the wine quality is good and the deal is good. That may be the case but that is irrelevant. NAKED WINES hide away from the truth and think they're clever in how they do it. They're NOT -they're just showing themselves to be completely disreputable.I suppose they might get famous one day in academic marketing journal on HOW NOT TO DO MAILINGS
NakedWines	GB	Nice wines, poor excuses.	08 December 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I've been a customer of Naked Wines for many years, but of late their customer service has plummeted. My last 2 orders were delayed and when I contacted them, I was given pathetic excuses.  After missing the promised delivery date, I asked when I would receive my order but I didn't even receive an approximation. Sad to see what was a good company become worse than second rate.
NakedWines	GB	service standards falling	08 December 2021	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	The order lead time seems to have crept up to nearly a week. I received my latest delivery two days late. There was no notification regarding this from Naked Wines. I found that one bottle was different to that ordered and two bottles were missing completely. The customer service staff were helpful but said they couldn't send the missing wines as they might break (?) and so refunded me and also added a goodwill amount to my  angel account. However overall it's increasingly the case that deliveries are late and I feel the standard of service is falling so will go elsewhere.Thank you Dominique for the reply and explanation which however doesn't explain why you couldn't send the missing wines or replace the incorrect bottle. With the refund (which was just for the two missing bottles) I'll go somewhere else to buy wine . . . .

NakedWines	GB	NO STARS! TAKE YOUR MONEY AND NO WINE DELIVERED. FOBBED OFF WITH EXCUSES AND FAKE DELIVERY DATES	07 December 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	"NO STARS!! HONEST REVIEW FROM AN ANGEL MEMBER.Been a member for a few months now. Saved up to use for Christmas wine (previously always used laithwaites but gave these cowboys my full trust and support).Chose my wines and chose Dec 1st as my delivery date. It is now Dec 7th and I am still without my case with little doubt I will receive it for Christmas going off other reviews. This will completely ruin my Christmas as I CAN NOT AFFORD to buy another case from elsewhere.The worst thing is the lack of honesty as to what the issue is, evident in the 3 (yes 3!!) emails I received from incompetent ""warehouse manager"" Gary, which said and I quote: Email Excuse 1: I'm really sorry - there was a problem at our warehouse last night and your wines missed the last trailer to make it to your local delivery depot.Enail Excuse 2: I’m embarrassed and very sorry to say that your order has missed the trailer for your local delivery depot for a second time.Despite our efforts, I’m sorry to tell you that we can’t get your wines to you today.Email excuse 3: It shouldn’t be the case that an order fails to leave our warehouse on time once, let alone three times, so I wanted to ensure I could explain why this has happened before sending you this message, and of course to reassure you as to when you’ll get your wine.Yes. 3 times Gary was unable to arrange to lift a box in to a van. But hey. It's only his job.If Naked Wines approached this with honesty to say what the real issue is, likely wines out if stock I'm guessing, i probably would have had more sympathy however I feel completely ripped off and let down by this joke of a business.Had a girl called Sarah email me with a supposed tracking number and a PROMISE my wine would be delivered today 7TH DEC. But guess what NO WINE. NO CONTACT. NO APOLOGY.Naked Wines. You are absolutely appalling and I want my money back immediately.

NakedWines	GB	So Far, So Good! - New Customer! - with later update!	06 December 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Only one star at the moment but will upgrade and edit this post as my first order progresses. (Promise!)Got my invite through the post today (Mon 6th Dec 21) and logged on to claim the £19.99 offer.Actually this is a very first time to respond to these, what I normally call junk mails that are so often posted through my door, and was tempted by the many good reviews here on Trustpilot, so here goes!Six bottles of Red that I have chosen, works out £3.33 a bottle along with free post.... I don't really expect a BIG wow with this, but we'll see. Will be back after the tasting sessions!Update: 29 May 2022 - Just finished the last of the six bottles and as promised, I can now review my above comments. What can I say? well, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the wines that I tasted and can say that I am really happy with what Naked wines sent me. I have actually given them all five stars.... even after having had to ask Naked wines NOT to keep sending me emails, they did honour my request and I have had no more of their marketing emails..... To be honest, I am not a big drinker, it has taken me since December last to get through these six bottles and I won't be ordering any more, BUT to those out there that drink a lot of wine, then Naked wines are fully recommended by me! Cheers.

NakedWines	GB	6th order and I'm loving the ride	04 December 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I'm really settling in with Naked - a little bit of a rocky start - first standard mixed crate using coupon was a little underwhelming.  My last 4 self selected orders have been great with some belting wines.  Good range and really helpful descriptions - only problem is my orders keep getting bigger! One occasion when the wrong crate was sent and that was speedily  corrected. Drivers and delivery times have been excellent.
NakedWines	GB	Naked wines no strings attached just good products.	04 December 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Naked wines offer a great range of superior wines  i was fed up of the same wines on supermarket shelves.

NakedWines	GB	Lost delivery	03 December 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I received an email saying there was a delay to my delivery.  Then got an email saying the courier had lost it.  I've repeatedly asked for a refund and cancellation acknowledgement, which hasn't elicited any reply other than an automated email inviting me to comment on how well someone called James has done in dealing with my enquiry.  Hopeless.
NakedWines	GB	Always something wrong	03 December 2021	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	I’ve been a customer for a few years now. They used to be really good but lately I get annoyed at every delivery.The wines themselves are nice enough for what you pay as an Angel member, BUT there is always something wrong at every delivery. I can’t remember last time I got my order in time and once they managed to deliver it to the wrong address. I get they contract out the delivery so it’s not all their fault, but it’s quite frustrating.The thing that I can’t get over is that I never get the wines I order! I have to check every time and there are always 2-3 bottles that are not what I asked for. A few months ago some bottles were missing as well.They’re normally quite good at refunding or giving me a few £ as compensation, but I shouldn’t need to check every time.It now happened so many times, I just can’t be bothered to even email them anymore.I really want to support smaller companies, but I might go back to buying wine from Waitrose or Virgin.
NakedWines	GB	Poor choice of wines all out of stock	03 December 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	As a regular monthly payee for a number of years, it is becoming really frustrating that the wines I have previously purchased are either out of stock or I have to reserve the next vintage. This is not good. Naked Wines use to have a great selection, but now, well as I write I would not recommend.
NakedWines	GB	A fab place to buy great wines	03 December 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	A fab place to buy great wines - at competitive prices – and support small vineyards.
NakedWines	GB	Delivery delay as of second order...	03 December 2021	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	"I took 'advantage' of a NW introductory offer which worked out ok, although none of the wines had the 'wow' factor I was hoping for. Overall, prices are a little higher than I'd expect to pay at a supermarket and I haven't detected much difference in quality between NW's selections and supermarket mid-higher priced wines.As I am a subscriber (not for much longer), my second purchase was a mixed 12 bottle Christmas box and again even though discounted was probably more than I'd need to spend for equivalent supermarket quality selections.Unfortunately, I've just been advised that, ""there was a problem at our warehouse last night and your wines missed the last trailer to make it to your local delivery depot"". So, no delivery as arranged today...hmmm stayed home especially too. No revised delivery day, so with this in mind is there any point in wasting any further time having a subscription.If you're going to sell yourself as a 'premium' operator, you need to back it up with exceptional service.Thanks."

NakedWines	GB	Not to my taste, but customer service was good.	02 December 2021	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	I made use of a voucher after a friend recommended Naked Wines. I was rather dubious of ordering up wine curated by A N Other but thought I'd risk it and got the red wine selection. The delivery was prompt and the communication excellent too. Unfortunately the wines were not to my liking, heavy in tannin and mostly 14/14.5% abv, not enjoyed any of them yet. I like a fruity grenache, an amabile or a primitivo. Smooth and low in tannins.13% abv is  enough for me. A Peter Lehmann Barossa valley grenache was an old favourite (altough they did tip 14%). I've not sent my naked wine order back because I feel responsible for my error. I've tried most of the selection and I just cancelled my Angel account. I wouldn't buy any of these wines again even if they were a fiver a bottle.
NakedWines	GB	Terrible delivery let's down whole business	02 December 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I posted the review below five days ago and thought I should provide an update. I contacted yodel myself and provided clear delivery instructions...which they had anyway having delivered Naked Wine here numerous times before. I was promised delivery the following day (Friday). Nothing happened. I contacted Naked who were apologetic and credited my account £25. They promised delivery yesterday saying weekend delivery was impossible so I waited in all day yesterday. It was no real surprise no wine arrived. Terrible service from Naked. Empty promises when they say all will be sorted out.Original review below.Why is it a potentially great company allows its reputation to be ruined by using a cheap and shoddy courier like yodel who consistently fail to deliver their wine? It is not a customers responsibility to chase yodel as the contractual relationship is between yodel and naked. I have wasted an hour on two days with yodel and still no wine. Maybe I should go elsewhere...
NakedWines	GB	A Satisfied Customer	02 December 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	We have been a customer of Naked Wines for a number of years and for all that time as an Angel.The wines (red, white and sparkling) we have received have always been consistently of a good quality and at a fair price, particularly when free Angel bottles are included.We are aware of Naked's quality guarantee to replace any bottle that is not to our satisfaction, but we have never felt the need to do so.I have seen reviewers refer to Naked's wines to be a similar quality to the discount supermarkets and therefore expensive. We beg to differ. When entertaining we have received many compliments.We have had the occasional minor problems with deliveries, particularly in recent times for obvious reasons, but these have always been sorted out quickly.In our opinion, having sampled the products from most of the wine 'clubs', Naked is a level above.Keep up the good work Naked.

NakedWines	JO	Terrible customer service	01 December 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Terrible customer service, I feel scammed. Upon making my first order I was given one month free of the angel program. I immediately cancelled it knowing that I wouldn’t use it. Find out later they still charged me. I went to log in with the same email I used originally, it doesn’t recognize me, went to reset the password, I’ve been waiting all day for the email, haven’t received anything. I don’t recommend nakedwines.com , would rate a zero if it allowed me to.Edit: Still waiting on reply from customer service, my info was sent to them. Further validating my review.

NakedWines	GB	Not for me...	01 December 2021	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	I've just cancelled my membership which wasn't too painful I am glad to say.  Sometimes, it can be a nightmare as you probably know.  Reason for cancelling was due to very mediocre wines.  RRP's are all over inflated making the 'angel' discounts look attractive on first glace.  Fact is they are not!  We all love a bargain but this is pushing it in my opinion.  Overall good service but much better value and variety out there if you look for it.

When they could not deliver on time they held the payment until it was delivered and then took it as promised, excellent service.I will look forward to a very Merry Christmas thanks to Naked Wines:-)Additional Note (read some bad reviews) - it is very clear when you sign up that money will be taken if you agree to become and Angel and also if you agree to receive the next vintage of a wine that you like - read the messages before you sign-up!Keep up the excellent service guys and have a great Christmas!Chris (wine guzzler)
NakedWines	GB	Introductory offer - table wines in the main	29 November 2021	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	Still not received any paperwork, despite asking for it on three separate occasions. Company not transparent about wine in case ordered - appears to be obfuscation in this regard. Company claims that the bottles of wine would normally cost within a range of £9 to £12 each. From my experience, the majority of wines in an introductory order would appear to be table wines, i.e. not quality assured. Only 3 out of the 12 wines in the box we purchased had a quality assurance. I would guess that the wines in these introductory offers would sell for about £4 to £4.50 in a Lidl’s supermarket.
NakedWines	GB	Avoid! Will take money from your account without authorisation.	29 November 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I would like to warn anyone out there tempted by the Naked Wines vouchers offers that seem like such good value at the time not to fall for it - they are after your card details and will take money without warning (and without you even setting up a direct debit )A friend gave me a voucher so I decided to order a discounted crate of wine the wine arrived - no problem there, and no issue with the wine.I then began to receive emails which I didn’t really understand telling me that I was now part of an angel investor club and that credit was being deposited into my angel investor account? I didn’t really understand this as I hadn’t signed up to be an Angel and there was no money deposited in my bank account so I just ignored it.Then I noticed a few weeks after my initial order that another amount of money had been taken out of my bank account - I couldn’t believe it! I made very sure when ordering the crate of wine there was no subscription and no signup to receive ongoing orders yet despite they had just lifted money straight out of my account. As far as I’m concerned this is tantamount to theft. I’ve since contacted Naked Wines and their customer service department has apologised and said they would refund me but I wonder how many people don’t complain or don’t notice that money is being taken. This company seems to operate in a very suspect way and is happy to just take money from people without warning, dressing it up in some Angel Investor blurb.In my opinion this is a disreputable practice and is basically stealing - I’m not really sure how they are even allowed to do this.If you’re thinking of buying a discounted crate from these guys don’t…it’s just not worth the hassle.

NakedWines	GB	Always Amazing	29 November 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I have been with Naked Wines for a couple years now and I have to absolutely say that their service/products are amazing. I was prompted to write a review after my recent christmas bundle was delayed (through the deliverers, not Naked Wines!) I rang/emails NW and they consistently kept me up to date with everything and gave me constant updates about my parcel, as well as £10 credit in my account! It is nice to know you can rely on the service they offer as well as the products which are always top-of-the-line. Its also nice to receive products which others don't, allowing me to try new things and get my friends/family to join. Honestly, I am not one to write reviews - but my recent experience has made me so happy I had to share it! Special shoutout to Sarah Pelling, who was absolutely lovely :)
NakedWines	GB	scam	29 November 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Don't start with this site, is a scam. I'm trying to finish the subscription after one week and they took 60 pounds from my account. Really bad. And is too hard to contact someone from the company to cancel this.
NakedWines	GB	Disappointing Delux Christmas box	28 November 2021	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	I ordered the Delux Christmas box. When it arrived (4 days late) it didn't contain the same wines that were advertised on the website.In fairness, when I contacted customer services they did say they would swap the wines I wasn't expecting, although they didn't say what for, given I can only assume the wines I ordered were out of stock. If that isn't the case then there is no excuse for not delivering what I paid for, and given that this was preordered, you would assume they actually had enough stock to cover the orders they accepted. However, that isn't what I'm most cross about. When I took delivery there was NOTHING to suggest what I was getting wasn't what I ordered. No packing note, nothing. So they just substituted white wines for red, no explanation, no apology, no notice. If they have to substitute, how about adding a note to the box saying they made a swap and what to do if you aren't happy about it rather than just ignoring it and hoping the customer won't notice. If you have to substitute, own it - take a lesson from the supermarkets who let you know when they have made a substitution.And an observation. If you are going to substitute wines, at least substitute white for white!
NakedWines	GB	It is impossible to judge whether the…	28 November 2021	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	"It is impossible to judge whether the wines are actually a ""good deal"" because you can't compare with other sellers. Naked Wines only sell their own wine so please tell me how am I to know what a great deal I'm actually getting?! I am now drinking their Le petite train by Katie Jones and it baffles me. It looks like a red, but sure as eggs are eggs it tastes like a white! The most bizarre wine I've ever had. I have purchased once - 6 bottles, and regardless of their ""Angels"" reviews will not be buying again. Very disappointed. Paul"

NakedWines	GB	Naked customer service made me change my review.	24 November 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I take it all back, read to the bottom for my horrific experience. But read on to hear how amazing their customer service is. Naked wines contacted me and asked to fix the issues of non delivery again from Yodel. Damien called me and asked how he could fix it. he actually cared and I am so grateful that he didn't make me feel like an idiot for my concerns of not getting my delivery. He made me feel like my custom was valued. This is a firm that believes in customer service. Thank you naked wines.My previous rating was this - I'd rate 0 if I could. They use Yodel to deliver (or not.) specify a date on the site for delivery and they simply don't bother to deliver. First order vanished - i was reimbursed so continued paying monthly to order a case for christmas... yep not been delivered and yodel can't tell me when I'll hear anything from them or if it will ever arrive! Cheers...

NakedWines	GB	Poor Service	23 November 2021	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	I signed up for a voucher, redeemed it and became an angel. I remember the first two, but not the third. I've got email confirmations of the first two, but not the third.I've had two of the half dozen bottles; the Portuguese red was really nice, the South African one not so much. I really don't have the right language skills to describe the taste wines but, full price, these are >£8 a bottle + shipping and don't seem particularly great value.However, as the continual stream of marketing tells me, this is (now was) not a simple transactional relationship, this is about blog posts and stories from small producers telling me how great naked wines are.I could have put up with this, well, muted them through the marketing preferences page, but I couldn't put up with their choice of courier. I've returned my wings and halo because of Yodel.I wanted my delivery signed for, not left in a foyer in a box proudly displaying where it had come from and I didn't want an argument with the driver about whether he had instructions to get a signature or not.I tried to contact you but couldn't get past Nacho. I complained to Yodel - no response. I gave you feedback - no response.All in all, I don't trust you to a deliver a good service.

I had a couple of problems with the site and requested help and a call back.1 week later i'm still waiting. Having come from a customer based Japanese manufacture where all complaints were dealt with within 24 hrs this has been tiresome.Heaven help if i had a delivery or payment problem i'd  probably have to wait a month.if this is how they treat new customers then its a perfect example of how not to do things
NakedWines	GB	Ordered via a voucher scheme as it…	23 November 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	UPDATE After leaving my review Naked Wines requested more information to deal with the issue. I provided the information as requested over a week ago and had no response at all; not impressed and account has been cancelled.Ordered via a voucher scheme as it looked like a good deal. Requested delivery on a specific day and that the courier got a signature as these services were offered on the website. Courier delivered a day early and left the box out in the rain on the road and claimed I had signed for it. Tried to webchat to Naked about this but can only speak to 'Nacho' an automated bot whose only purpose seem to be to put you in an endless loop and won't let you actually speak to anyone. Appreciably most of the issue is likely down to the courier but given the difficulty trying to speak to them I would not use them again.

NakedWines	GB	When I received my case	22 November 2021	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	When I received my case, I was concerned at the very high ABV wines. Mostly 14% 14.5%.  I much prefer red wines 12% 12.5%, whites 11%, 11.5%.  My case included four wines with silly names I would not have normally chosen, both badged 'Naked'. The case included an envelope containing unashamedly further marketing offers - I do feel a bit taken-in.  On balance, I think Tesco's 25% on 12 is a better deal.

NakedWines	GB	Angels Club	22 November 2021	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	Angels Club - going downhill.Have been a member for a year, I was feeling quite good about Naked Wines except for an unexpected/unexplained substitute wine every now and again. Then they ‘changed warehouse’ and it’s gone downhill. Last order was delivered over 50% wrong, with an incorrect wine count too. Service was very pleasant and nice, but in the end still incompetent. Delivery via Yodel isn’t helping, they keep trying to deliver even when I’ve told them not to ! And then Naked contacted me to ask me why, even though I asked them not to deliver until a certain date either. My last order has taken hours of sorting out. I shall be cancelling.Update : in the end Naked Wines did everything they could to rectify this and I now have all my wines ! I'm left wondering about Yodel as a delivery agent, who screwed up multiple times, but Naked themselves really looked after me :-) Thank you.

NakedWines	GB	Disgusting Service	15 November 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	"I had an email telling me my order would be delivered between 1:00 and 2:00   By 2:30 there was no delivery and on looking at my emails found that the wine had been left in a safe place??  Bearing in mind I live in a Seniors complex on the fourth floor, I checked downstairs and the so called ""safe place"" was directly in front of the front door in full view of anyone coming in from outside.  I am a widow of 77 yrs old and had no idea how to get this wine upstairs.  After having surgery affecting both arms,  I have no strength in my arms.  PLUS why should I be expected to carry this upstairs.  Just as an aside the Amazon driver delivered a DVD player the same day and phoned to let me know he was there and brought the parcel up to my apartment and after knocking asked me if I could lift the parcel because if not he would.  Now I call that great service compared to the service I received.  Also it is helpful to note that none of the residents are able to help in carrying this wine upstairs.  At great inconvenience to him, I had to phone my son and ask him if he could possibly come over (he lives 30 miles away) to lift the wine for me.  In conclusion, I will NOT be ordering any more wine from Naked.  Surely their delivery people should respect people more than this??"

NakedWines	GB	Great customer service	09 November 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	
NakedWines	GB	Poor delivery service + nil customer service.	09 November 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Purchased over the weekend and was promised delivery Monday, with the proviso that it may be a day late. No contact from Naked Wines even though I’ve “spoken” through their chat line and also emailed. Yodel tracking says my wine was damaged and sent back to naked. No idea when I will receive my order. Not impressed at all with the customer service, which basically is no service. Doesn’t look like Naked are that bothered about my future business.Laughable reply….Naked Wines only reordered when I let them know my order had been returned damaged. I only found that out when I looked into why the delivery was late. Think they need to seriously look at their relationship with their deliverer, Yodel. Very poor communication all round. I won’t be ordering again after the very poor first experience.2nd update. Reordered by Naked for delivery today. Just checked and it’s been returned damaged…again. Will I ever see my order? Do they ever actually deliver anyone’s order. Seems so by the ‘genuine’ ???😂😂😂 generic reviews they keep posting. Think VERY carefully before ordering, you’ll get nothing more than grief and hassle.
NakedWines	GB	Excellent wine, naff delivery	09 November 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I've been a Naked Angel for many years but left them due to constant delivery issues.  I'd still recommend them; I've only ever had one wine that I disliked but that was personal preference and not because of the quality.  If you have no issues with Yodel, and enjoy a glass or two and happy to try something off the beaten track I'd recommend without haste

NakedWines	GB	Excellent company and delicious wine…	08 November 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Excellent company and delicious wine that I would not get the opportunity to purchase had I not discovered naked wines,but also I am supporting independent wine makers to continue to produce their excellent wine. Thoroughly worth every penny the quality of wine available is fantastic. I would recommend to anyone.
NakedWines	GB	Avoid, it’s a con!	07 November 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	At no point did I agree to sign up for any monthly payments and yet noticed that £25 was being taken from my account as a monthly recurring payment. Yet my account t was. It credited with any money to spend, nor was any product being sent to me. Not only will I never shop from Naked Wines again, but I will tell everyone I know to avoid such an underhand and misleading company who claim to be helping independent wine makers but do so by stealing your money. AVOID!Update: Naked Wines have now reached out suggesting that it is my fault for not spotting emails they claim they sent.This is simply unacceptable, I did not agree to sign up to anything, I did not tick any boxes or submit any direct debit information - this is nothing more than a scheme designed to dupe people into signing up to something.It is the responsibility of the seller to make any financial agreement clear, obvious and understandable. From the number of reviews across the web complaining of the same problem, I think it is pretty clear they do not do this.

I called this morning, was immediately given a refund and also, on asking, was directed to the Christmas box selection.  My choice made, my order will arrive on Monday.  It is so easy, with excellent wines to choose from, amazing customer service.  What's not to love about being a Naked Angel?!

I felt very insecure. Always when I buy I choose my card details not to be stored or remembered but this doesn’t work with them. Avoid this company.
NakedWines	GB	Great quality and good price	04 November 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Great quality and good price. We receive vouchers with every order and get discounts on every order basically. It costs £19.99 for 6 bottles, great value. I would recommend it.

NakedWines	GB	Incorrectly charges without explanation	04 November 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Very suspect billing and charging methods.  I used a £75 voucher to place an order, and they took money without any explanation or warning, ignoring the voucher totally, over two consecutive days.  The figures in the order/transaction history pages do not add up at all. Never opted into any subscriptions. No replies to emails.RESPONSE: There was no 'angel' literature with the voucher, more importantly you still haven't explained why I have been charged a total of £141.82 despite the order being £131.82, less £75 voucher = £56.82.  No refund or explanation received and the amounts charged don't add up to the original order.  Future customers need to read this to be aware of your concerning operations.
NakedWines	GB	Mailbox assault. Your details are their real harvest	04 November 2021	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	Wines are great, 6 bottles for £19.99 on an offer. But bl##dy Hell, the emails and 'offers' are relentless. So many so often, you cant keep up with the deletions. In my view, its a con just to hlow-up your inbox.
NakedWines	GB	Naked Wines are excellent - Yodel delivering for them ruins it!!!	04 November 2021	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	"Naked Wines are excellent. The business ethic is brilliant, the wines are great, the people are fabulous.Their delivery service provider Yodel is appalling and detracts enormously from the benefits of buying from Naked for me and others  Yodel persist in leaving my wines with random ""neighbours"" up to a mile away, suggesting they have left a card with the location at my home (they do not). They do not put this neighbour's location on their tracking app so you have to spend time contacting them. I feel it's no coincidence that the ""rate your delivery"" button on the app never connects. Naked apologise each time this happens but Yodel show no interest in getting their local driver actually delivering properly. It will be a shame to stop buying wine from this excellent company but it will be a lot easier to drive to the nearest branch of Oddbins and buy some of their wines."
NakedWines	GB	Easy to use website	03 November 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Easy to use website, explains everything.
NakedWines	GB	Great wines	03 November 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Great wines, perfect price with the offer for new customers, but to be an Angel is quite expensive.
NakedWines	GB	Brilliant! 😇	03 November 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Love naked wines. Have been an Angel for a long time and cannot fault their service. Many negative reviews appear to be misunderstanding of how the company operates/how subscriptions work but from my perspective they are clear, fair and transparent. I pay £20 a month which I usually spend on a brilliant Christmas case (unless something else tempts me beforehand!!). Top marks from me ⭐️
NakedWines	GB	Terrible service.	03 November 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I ordered some wine on the 24th Oct and was told it would be delivered on the 27th Oct. I then receive an email saying the wine has been damaged and I will receive it on the 29th. I took this in good faith and waited until I got another email saying that the wine has again been damaged and I will receive it on the 1st Nov. I then get an email on the 1st Nov saying it has been damaged and I will receive it on the 3rd Nov and told I will be refunded £20. I have not seen any money come my way and get a further email today saying it can't be delivered. The whole situation is frankly ridiculous and I have requested a refund. How on earth a company can operate like this is beyond belief and I can only presume their preferred delivery method is by catapult based on how much wine they break.
NakedWines	GB	Voucher offer	03 November 2021	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	Received a voucher and was going to order but web site was very confusing with deals all over the place so gave it a miss, pity for I used to have a long term with Laithwaites who were very good.

NakedWines	GB	Why not?	31 October 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I signed up over a year ago with a view to exploring something different to the Off Licence offering. £20 a month which to be honest is only a couple of bottles of “Hit and Hope” and I get some really interesting wines with a great story behind them. Of course there are many other clubs to choose from however I am happy to recommend this one.
NakedWines	GB	Lack of transparency of monthly fees	30 October 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Got a naked wines deal through the post. Went through it to see how much they were for, for monthly membership as an angel … I had to hunt it was not obvious.. eventually 2/3 of the way down the terms and condition £10 a month.. under circumstances I might of signed up but if they insist on hiding there fees they can forget it.
NakedWines	GB	Dishonest and misleading marketing	30 October 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	The range is very limited - they only have literally one Champagne and that is not a good one.  The prices are quoted as being at a large discount but the discounted price (or lower) is usually available elsewhere so the “discount” isn’t a discount at all.  It’s a subscription service but that is deliberately concealed.The language is typical marketing puffery but when you look into the details of this “doozy” of an offer, it’s not a doozy at all.Anyone thinking of taking Naked Wines up on one of its misrepresented offers should carefully check whether the same or better wines are available elsewhere at a better price - they usually are.
NakedWines	GB	Naked Wine is a monthly Investment /…	29 October 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Naked Wine is a monthly Investment / subscription service which you only find out once an account and order has been placed.The monthly amount set is £25 but can be changed to the minimum £20 in your account settings.There is no mention of any monthly charge on their mailshots, vouchers or order page and are not being  transparent about an automatic monthly charge.I telephoned once I found out and requested my order and account to be cancelled, which their customer service adviser apologised and processed my request and cancelled both order and closure of my account.

NakedWines	GB	Amazing wines at reasonable prices, appalling delivery service	27 October 2021	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	Amazing wines at reasonable prices, but terrible delivery service as NakedWines have chosen Yodel as their courier for some godforsaken reason - the worst rated delivery service in the country for several years running. My partner and I have waited in three days for our case, which we saved up for over a long period and have been really looking forward to. Each delivery slot has come and gone without the doorbell to our flat ringing a single time, despite speaking to customer services and telling them that the driver needs to ring for our flat so we can let them in. We will keep trying because its worth it for the incredible wines, but my god this is frustrating. The compensation we have been offered is also a thinly disguised attempt to get us to spend even more money on another case to get a 'free bottle'. I have reached the point of sitting by the window and keeping a watch out for Yodel drivers so I can run down and catch them before they drive off. Waste of time. Grrr.

Absolutely brilliant and I’d like to say that Emilia especially was a total delight. My case was slightly late in arriving (no fault on NW’s part)..an immediate email to inform me.

Sure, there are companies that sell some better wines and there may well be some companies that sell cheaper wines.  But when you factor in the work that Naked Wines do for nascent wine growers worldwide (just Google Katie Jones for an example) and the amazing charity work that they support (check out the Carmen Stevens Foundation), then you'll see that they could possibly be the best company in the world, not just the best wine company!

NakedWines	GB	Exceptional	22 October 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I have always been a huge wine fan, preferring to buy from independant shops rather than the supermarkets but for years was put off joining up to Naked Wines.Why? I thought it was a con. A scam. The wines would be expensive......and so on.12 months ago I got the standard offer and decided to give it a try. Honestly, as a wine lover it's the best thing I did.It has introduced me to a massive selection of wine I would never have tried before. By rating the wine that you've bought, it very cleverly starts to build up an idea of your taste and advises whether it thinks you'll like a certain one, or definitely won't. And the best bit - if you don't like a bottle, email them and they'll refund you.I order now pretty much on a monthly basis. Yes, deliveries can occasionally be late and I also wish they would use DPD rather than Yodel but it's a small price to pay for the quality that you get. Many of the wines cost less than you'd pay for a 'good' bottle in a supermarket.Customer service is excellent and just reading the stories of the winemakers that they use make the whole experience amazing.
NakedWines	GB	Trick would not recommend	21 October 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Even with one star your reviews are going up. But i think it's rather an insult to try to con people of their money. I believe in value for money. I received a £75 voucher off to buy a 12 bottle pack wine that i cannot use no where else. Please folks do the maths. They offering12 delicious wines £3.99 per bottle.Wine cost £122.88Voucher.  -£075.00 You pay   £047.88If you calculate price of wine £3.99 x 12 =£47.88 how can you say you giving me £75.off. The £122.88 is a marketing sale trick. Stop Sending voucher in the post that doesn't worth a thing. still havent  justify the calculation. would be better off buying the wine at 3.99 per bottle.

NakedWines	GB	Ever so slightly disappointed	20 October 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Not off to a good start. Introductory offer is going to be late. Have now read other reviews and am wondering whether I should have stayed with my previous supplier. Shame the reason for late delivery is not a little more specific. Unable to put onto trailer could mean a multitude of different problems. Wines better live up to expectation and arrive soon if you wish to keep my custom. (WR2)
NakedWines	GB	Naked Wines - a big con !!	20 October 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Got a flier from them through the post offering 6 bottles for £19.99 at an e mail address.

NakedWines	GB	Do not use this company	19 October 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Do not use this company. My order never came and I ordered it with adequate time ahead of a friends birthday. Broken bottles and then not on the van again, which I have heard from others. Then assured me it would come and still didn’t. By the third promise, enough was enough. What a shame! Refund given, but too late, after I had been to the shops the night before to replace the missing wines.
NakedWines	GB	Stop using Yodel	19 October 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Stop using Yodel ! 4 attempts to deliver each time around my area 2 hours after the last estimated delivery time and didn’t attempt to deliver.

NakedWines	GB	I’m giving this a 2+	19 October 2021	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	I’m giving this a 2+, and that’s generous tbh. The wines are “ok”, however for the price you CAN get better. When Naked wines started the idea it was way cheaper and also after getting a voucher ir gift card it didn’t mean you had to match the same amount more or less to be able to even use it. It has a bit of a “I’m being hustled” feeling to it, though not a full blown scam. You’re not really getting a discount as the prices after discount is what they’re planning on selling for regladles so yeh it’s abit so so. Another thing is they’re using Yodel for delivery which I’ve had lots of hassle with, not to mention, drivers don’t wear a mask when delivering during the pandemic, or atleast I haven’t seen one who does even after clear instructions in the notes. When raising these things you get a very scripted and generic reply promising to take your feedback onboard from Naked wines, which is just frustrating as we know that doesn’t go anywhere and you’ll keep having the same experience. Think I’ll get my wines elsewhere moving forward tbh…

NakedWines	GB	Wines at their finest	18 October 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	We started using Naked Wines a few months ago and love everything about it. We’ve had 4 orders so far and they have been absolutely superb with choice, price and optional delivery scales. We love the fact that a wine gets thrown in for you which if you take this cost into account with your other 12 bottles it brings the price down greatly. We’ve been honest and given our reviews as to what wines we enjoy most or least and love the fact independent wine makers reply with their own message. I enjoy that I as they account holder can download the Naked Wines App to my phone which makes ordering simple by either finger or face recognition. I can access my account easily and view all my orders and change my monthly amount at any time. I also encountered a problem when I lost my wallet, so had to wait for new cards. It was simple and straightforward to add my new card even receiving an email from Ed thanking me for updating my details. We my husband and I are enjoying being part of Naked Wines and look forwards to remaining within them for the foreseeable future. Great wines from wonderful wine makers which you can’t buy on the high street. Easy, fast ordering and delivery service. And any query dealt with effectively, swiftly and efficiently by customer services. Glad to be aboard.

The beautiful thing about this is, they use our funding and distribute it to the fabulous wine makers all over the world.

Lets be honest if they offering good wine cheaper than the supermarkets delivered to you door for free then they going to want future business and why not indeed.Its makes the world go round and everyone`s happy. As soon as you sign up you receive several email explaining the order and the ""Angels club"". They can be any more transparent. One advantage I must add they let you order the wine and not just ping a case to arrive every 8 /10 weeks. If you don`t want don`t act like a baby and moan on a public open site. Just simply call up or possibly live chat and they can`t be any more helpful. I not sure I can mention other companies but Naked and Laithwaites are super to deal with (Virgin Wines stay WELL clear of). Will continue to use Naked as feel from a service perceptive they are trying very hard in a highly competitive market."
NakedWines	GB	Change review due to excellent response from 2 to 4	09 October 2021	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	Coming back with a review change because the issue was explained and the problem was sorted out. I will still leave the initial review for everything to make sense. //Worst experience ever! I can not cancel my account after they took monthly £25. I cancel my subscription 2 months ago and nothing! Still took my money from the account. Shame on you Naked wines...naked character//
NakedWines	GB	Nice wine, subscription model not for me	09 October 2021	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	"I received a voucher for £75 off 12 bottles of wine. Rarely an offer such as this is without a catch, but the ""catch"" was easy to find. If you read the FAQs on the website it is printed clearly about signing up to be an ""Angel"". It is also listed in the small print T's and C's. I used the voucher, ordered a case and received an email about the ""Angel"" membership. Cancelling the membership was easily found and located. South Park covered the repercussions of not reading T's and C's when agreeing terms in reference to a well-known company named after a fruit... Be warned about not reading small print!Opting in is a basic tactic - people tend to be more likely to remain ""opted in"" as it is easier than taking action to ""opt out"". However, I read the Naked responses to negative reviews and it seems Naked are unaware of their own processes:1. A pop up box at check out did NOT appear informing me of the ""Angel"" membership. 2. For those who have said Yodel (Naked's delivery partner) left their delivery unsigned; the default delivery option is to leave at the front door, unsigned. This needs to be manually changed shortly after check out should one wish to edit, either to edit safe place drop point or to specify signed for delivery. At least, that was what I encountered.My frustration is that my card details remain on the system without me able to remove them. Hoping that people will resubscribe rather than giving autonomy over this decision (but this is also stated in the T's and C's).Offer - a good offer but a shame I wasn't able to purchase organic wine with the voucher. I would have happily purchased an organic case.Wine - only tried one bottle so far which was pleasant.Delivery - arrived on day it was meant to arrive.Angel membership - can understand why this is marketed but it isn't for me. I prefer to order wine as and when rather than rely on a subscription model."

NakedWines	MT	The worst service I've experienced	08 October 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	The worst service I've experienced.   Scheduled a delivery for a full week away and it simply didn't show up.    Customer service promised it would be the next day so I took time off work.    I enquired after 10am but no - it wasn't even on the van.   They are blaming COVID, Brexit and Hitler for their complete inadequacy.   No - you are using Yodel.   Your customer service agents shouldn't be telling customers things they can't guarantee. I quite rightly got a bit annoyed with them and my account was closed by them.   Good riddance.  I'd rather drink pish than order from a company who don't care about customers. In summary,  you'll likely be disappointed.   Their prices are too much for what they claim and customer service do zero for you.
NakedWines	GB	The ordering process is simple	08 October 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	The ordering process is simple, thanks to good design.
NakedWines	GB	When you mess up, sort things out.	07 October 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I posted the first review below 4 days ago. See below. They got in touch for my order number which i gave them. Gave me a £50 back, but not received it yet, just told me its coming. However my actual order was resent today. The original notification said it would come tomorrow. When i got the notification that it was coming today i was out. As soon as i got home realising it hadn’t arrived I realised what was likely to have happened. Naked Wine  chose to try a different postcode so Yodel went to my house number on a different street. Regardless of what the street name on the box was reading. My  house is  new. We moved in 4 months ago. Realising this might happen I went to talk to the owner at the postcode they used. Yodel came this morning but the house owner said it wasn’t for him. He knew my name from the attempted  delivery. Yet they still sent an email saying they had delivered. Which is blatantly not true. Get a grip. Your business relies on your delivery ability. Review from earlier Ive just rang naked wines. Full of consolation but no help. After my last order got lost i sent detailed instructions on how to find us. Received promises that they would sort out the delivery instructions. This order one case got lost Tuesday, the other yesterday. No one seems to know, including Yodel where they delivered my cases too. And no one can tell me how they intend to fix it. Last time a kind neighbour left it on my doorstep when i was out but no idea who that was. Come on,  don’t make promises that  you will sort things when you don’t even pass on the ‘how to find me’ instructions to Yodel. And when yodel lose cases do try to follow up and tell the customer what’s happening. Silence reigned supreme today! Then I phoned.  Do train your staff to tell the customer what you intend to do.  Consolation, nice words don’t amount to anything if no follow through.

NakedWines	GB	Customer Service Front End sucks...	06 October 2021	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	"Wanted to change credit card details on order I submitted 5 minutes before. no PERSON TO TALK TO. Their chat bot broken. And message SORT OF SAYING.. ""don't send us emails as too busy with these Covid times.. really! About time stopped using that excuse... AND STOP relying on automated bots to answer customers needs! .. Get some REAL people in if you are that busy. Wines okish.. Just. But Customer service front end terrible. Going to cancel one of our subscriptions anyway. And that was the clincher. So well hidden in their website.. ie how to change credit cards. cancel etc.. VERY SNEAKY! Bye Naked Wines... too big for your boots. Ray the wine guy..what cosy BS! PS check out Amazon. They manage both online and offline customer service perfectly... and just a little bit bigger than you..."
NakedWines	GB	In reply to Dominique...	05 October 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	...Here is the email Naked Wines sent 19/12/20. It is clear the funding for your 'woke' vanity projects does NOT only come from donations. Substantial funds come via the business in one way or another:Why would you ask to be held 'accountable' to Angels, unless you were accounting for giving away some of the quoted '80% growth' in the form of freebies for people whose skin isn't pale? Oh, and 'Eamon the wine guy' left Naked Wines a few weeks later! So much for his long term commitment. 'writing the cheque is the easy bit', he said at the time. Well, yes, spending other people's money then removing oneself from the accountability chain is indeed 'easy'. If only he'd stuck solely to this statement: 'My job is to find you the world's best independent winemakers'. HelloToday we’re making a $500,000 promise to improve diversity in the wine industry.This is not intended to be another bland and empty corporate statement. So please read on.But first, a reflection.My job is to find you the world’s best independent winemakers.One of the ways I find them is based on their winemaking credentials. If I come across someone who has made one of the most sought after and impressive wines in the world, well they go straight to the top of my hitlist.The events in the US over the summer, and subsequent protests all over the world have brought this way of working into sharp focus.The undeniable fact is that the majority of winemakers who hold these coveted positions tend to skew towards a fairly white and fairly male profile.I write this as one of those senior white blokes in a coveted position, but please bear with me.There’s no skirting around the truth here – the wine industry is a very white industry......and while it’s generally a very good industry, those who don’t look like the majority face constant barriers and stumbling blocks to progress their careers.In the US, for example, over 98% of winery owners or winemakers are white. I look at our own winemaker community across the world, and that number is even higher.We believe that it’s time to give more people a fair crack at success in the wine industry. To give the winemakers of tomorrow the best chance of breaking through.It’s a big challenge – but we’ve already made a startFor 5 years now, we have been sowing the seeds for future generations of winemakers in South Africa, thanks to you and your fellow Angels’ donations.In partnership with the Carmen Stevens Foundation, 11,650 underprivileged kids are being fed breakfast and lunch every day in primary schools on the outskirts of Cape Town and Stellenbosch.Given their proximity to wine country, there’s a good chance that many of these kids will end up working in the industry.So if we can get more of them to complete their education, we’ll get more of them from the fields into the wineries... and from the least rewarding, lowest-paid jobs to some of the highest.Alongside this, since 2018 our Naked Bursary has been funding two Black students to study the Enology degree in Stellenbosch University.But there’s so much more to doToday we’re stepping up our efforts. Here’s what we’re going to do next:    We’re launching a full winemaking scholarship in the US, in partnership with The Roots Fund. This will cover the accommodation and tuition fees at the University of California Davis, America’s most prestigious wine school, for one Black, LatinX or Indigenous student per year for the next five years    Alongside this we will continue to fund two winemaking scholarships in South Africa each year through the Naked Bursary    We’re also creating a winemaker mentoring program in the US with The Roots Fund, to give budding Black, LatinX or Indigenous winemakers the chance to launch their own wines with the mentorship of our winemakers. With no obligation to sell it on Naked Wines.This is a five year commitment, which will cost $500,000Signing the cheque is the easy bit. What happens after that is what matters most.Some of our best winemaking and business brains have eagerly come forward to offer their mentoring support.We are hopeful that with you on our side, and the best people on board, we can make real change.This is our pledge to you – please hold us accountableYou may have seen our financial results we released a few weeks ago – sales up 80%, Angels globally up to 750,000 (!) – it’s clear we have built an amazingly powerful community together.With that growth comes a responsibility to use the power of our community for good.I’m letting you know because I want you to hold us accountable to our promise.I’m also letting you know because I want to say thank you. You and 749,999 others around the world have made this possible.We’ll keep you posted about our progress, and the people involved whose lives are going to be changed.Cheers,Eamon, Wine Guy

NakedWines	GB	Love Naked Wines	04 October 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Love Naked Wines, it's a great idea. I always enjoy reading the blurb on each bottle and learning a little about the wine maker. The wine is always so good too, definitely worth it :)
NakedWines	GB	If It Seems To Good To Be True Be Aware!	03 October 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	"There's a saying..""If it seems to good to be true it usually is"" And never has it been more true when said in relation to Naked Wines. I received a voucher for £1,200  worth of wine  for a purchase price of just £65 through an Amazon purchase. I did think this has to be  a scam and yes it turned out to be.The offer was for 12 bottles of 'finely selected wines from individual growers'. Seemed too good to be true, and it was. What arrived was not 12 bottles of wine but five bottles of mediocre wine and a bottle of promotional gin.I contacted Naked Wines who informed me the five bottles of wine and the bottle of gin was worth  £1,200  which I found hard to believe.A week later I was surprised when viewing my bank statement to find that Naked Wine had deducted £40 without my permission of knowledge. That is fraud no matter what blurb they post about being an 'angel' online. They had used my card which I had given details to purchase the '12 bottles'  (that never materialised) to illegaly deduct without my knowledge £40 from my account. Surely this is dishonest and a matter for Trading Standards.Of the five bottles that arrived one was good the rest mediocre. Why is Amazon.com complicit in this scam because it is a scam. When a company promises you a case of 12 bottles of wine for a set price plus the voucher, then sends you five bottles and deducts £40 from your account without your knowledge it is deception dishonest and fraud.I have emailed Naked Wines requesting that they refund me the £40 and unsubscribe me from their mailing list. They type a lot of superlatives about their wines and how they 'responsibly source from independent growers etc'.But at the end of the day their practise of operating is dishonest and from now I'll stick to my local Aldi which stocks decent wines for a fiver and do not illegally deduct £40 from your bank account without your knowledge the following week."

I have reported them to the financial ombudsman. Illegal trading & ripping people off with cheap wine I wouldn’t use to cook! Company is a disgrace! Shop local avoid these cowboys.What part of don’t sign people up do you not understand? People don’t want a subscription it’s an insult to their intelligence. Can you  honestly imagine buying a holiday & every month they take money off you  saying oh it’s money for future holidays it’s absolutely absurd!… incidentally most companies take PayPal you should be able to pay in whichever way you choose. Naked wines should never ever be able to get away with this it is fraudulent and totally unexceptionable. Shame on this company very poor show!… why don’t you take PayPal or cheques? It’s because  you set up fraudulent subscriptions which incidentally no one knows about! How are you still allowed to trade Poor show!…
NakedWines	GB	Be aware; they use Yodel!	02 October 2021	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	Placed an order and was asked if I would like the case of wine left on its own, or re-delivery attempted if I wasn’t in. I chose re-delivery as obviously didn’t want a large amount of wine just left in the porch. Pointless asking me, as I wasn’t in and the wine was left on the doorstep! I checked the delivery company’s sticker; Yodel! Enough said!!!!
NakedWines	US	Please do not trust	30 September 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Please do not trust! During the order process there's no mention of keeping your card on file and automatically charging you each month.  It comes as a surprise when you get a charge on your card next month.

I opened the mixed case immediately to check that I had got what I asked for as quite ofter companies substitute if the run out. The full price was £187.38 less Angel saving giving a balance of £110.00 in the selection where two bottles valued at £22.99 each listed in the packing note but substituted with 2 no. £9.00 bottles. Infuriated I tried to contact them eventually using the useless bot which then send you an acknowledgement and say done chase as this will put you to the back of the queue, we try to get back to you with 24 hrs but could take upto 72 hrs. Not happy! and there's no phone number on the site to contact them also the help but does nor work.
NakedWines	GB	A company that does not disappoint	28 September 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Sometimes you get a good company, but rarely a great company. I have been happily drinking some excellent wines from Naked for several years - choice and then delivery always seem easy and top notch. On the very rare occasion that something is not quite right, they are very quick both to respond and remedy the situation. Really good customer service all round.

NakedWines	GB	Led by marketeers, not wine enthusiasts	27 September 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I received a £75 voucher - excited to try Naked Wines. I searched for Dry White French Wines, a couple of Chablis/Petite Chablit looking worth a try - to see that all but two of this filtered selection are reserved for 'Angel' customers who pay £20 a month by DDM (and neither of the two available were Chablis).  I did not progress but felt a bit cheated into wasting my time on their website. It looks like NW are Led by marketeers, not wine enthusiasts I fear.

You can get really special, unique wines and directly benefit local suppliers and growers. It really isn't more expensive than a supermarket - you can opt for cheaper bottles if you're on a budget and still get something of really good quality. Obviously there are disruptions to delivery and services at the moment - if you have any issues just contact Customer Service. They're super helpful. One star reviews below are just mean - ignore them!

NakedWines	GB	Zombie company	24 September 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	"This was a good company providing a good service till this summer. I tried to place an order via the app but it no longer accepted my thumbprint as verification, asking me for my password. I couldn't remember so asked for a reset. a dozen attempts and a week later, no emailed reset link has turned up. I phone customer services, only to be told they are out of service due to ""retraining"". I try the live web chat, no one available. yet they still took out the monthly ""angel""contribution. This is beyond terrible customer service. I think they've gone bust."
NakedWines	GB	Brilliant marketing, poor quality wine	24 September 2021	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	"Wanted to like this idea, and when the 12-bottle case arrived ahead of schedule, was delighted.  First out was a ""Van de France,"" -- alas, hardly ""world-class,"" and full of sulphites that kept us awake. 'Ray,' the founder, is a superb marketeer, and you can see why, given his macho image on the brochure that arrived later telling us we would now be an ""Angel,"" paying £25 a month, why he likes the world ""naked.""   He is ""travelling the world"" to find 'independent' winemakers, so no climate concern there.  Virgin wines, also online, is no better.  Suggest you try Aldi's, or just your local supermarket/corner shop.  Many now also deliver, or do 'click and collect.'"

I wasn't expecting much more. I also wasnt expecting to find that i'd been added as an ""angel"" and would be charged £25 per month into a naked wines account. This could be cancelled and I have processed for a refund but this is just one of those really annoying tactics companies use. I read things pretty carefully when I'm buying online but I obviously missed anything about being signed up to this service. Make it more obvious. I only knew I had been signed up as my banking app notified me this morning that £25 had been paid to Naked Wines. Would have had no idea otherwise. Stop it."

I planned to unsubscribe because the full price is not cheap. However on reflection I'm going to stay subscribed because: the selection is clearly well made for my taste, the business model is good, ( it is reasonably clear that you are signing up and easy to unsubscribe)I like the fact you accumulate credit you can spend or not when you wish. No random monthly cases arriving.These wines complement the supermarket staples I will continue to purchase. They are interesting and quaffable

NakedWines	GB	promo	20 September 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Hi, I have just recieved my first order and am somewhat confused, the offer was £128.88 of wine with £75 off with a voucher, the delivered wine has a value of £98.98 effectively reducing the voucher value in half. In addition the wines are rated rather low on your own customers assessment's, as low as 81% !! not what I would have anticipated on the first promo offer. There was no list of the wines supplied in the delivery. If I attempt to contact NW I can only access an automated system.   Rather disappointing to say the least

NakedWines	GB	Good wines, good service, bad rating system	17 September 2021	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	A good place to buy wines, especially if you are sick of the same old stuff from the supermarket. Their moneyback guarantee is really good (I've used it) and they are super friendly and helpful. My main complaint is the rating system, which tries to sign you up for automatic cases every time you leave a review. And when you do rate it's little help to you as you can't see your own ratings when you brows to buy more wines. If I have tried and rated a wine I want to see that score, not what other people think. A couple of times I have accidently brought an average wine again because I forgot that they were quite forgettable.

NakedWines	GB	Sly entrapment of signing up.	09 September 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	So bought once on a special offer. No indication I was signing up to monthly payments. I see many replies here to say that there’s a 30 day guarantee to cancel. But this was not not made obvious at all. In fact it said you would not be charged unless I have permission. I didn’t sign anything or give permission for you to take further payment from my account. Very deceiving and underhand. Not transparent at all. It’s very sly and manipulative in fact entrapment. The lure with false sense of thinking you’re getting a good deal. Only to automatically sign you up -the kind of thing that I thought the Uk was trying to stop. Clearly not doing a very good job of doing so. Think this is a trading standards issue. As it does seem that I’m unlikely to get a refund or to cancel my account by reading other people’s messages on here. Hopefully I’ll have better luck.

NakedWines	GB	Extremely friendly and helpful	09 September 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I've been a Naked Wines customer for a while now, but have never had any cause to contact them - until today, when a bottle of wine I'd ordered got switched with another by mistake.  Helen, the customer service agent I spoke to, couldn't have been friendlier or more helpful and the issue was resolved immediately.  I very much enjoy being a customer of Naked Wines - the wine is always outstanding, and their business seems to be run in fair, friendly way that's much appreciated, especially in these weird times of ours!

NakedWines	GB	You don’t get anything for nothing AVOID AVOID AVOID	08 September 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	You don’t get anything for nothing! This is a full on SCAM so watch out. Other companies such as fabletics are doing this pointless subscription which is concealed and almost impossible to cancel. Furthermore when payment is taken it is even harder to get in touch with anyone.Why do we even need to subscribe anyway! If we wanted wine, we would simply buy it.These companies know full well what they are doing and will make a lot of unauthorised cash in the process. Please guys just spend a bit more and go to a proper wine supplier.You can almost guarantee other reviews are fake* Naked Wines, please don’t bother sending an automated non apologetic response as you do others.
NakedWines	GB	Great wines at reasonable prices.	07 September 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Great wines at reasonable prices.Cannot understand all the negative comments regarding the introductory offer. If you can read and take the trouble to do so, how is it possible not understand the Angels offer? In any case the company take all the risk, you get your money back if you do not want to stay a member simples! as the meerkats say!!
NakedWines	GB	Concealed subscription	06 September 2021	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	I received an offer from Naked  Wines with my copy of Private Eye and thought I would try it. The wine arrived today and I imagine it is good value. Having become a bit concerned about the slick marketing I looked for reviews and found the comments by others on Trust pilot.  As others have said it is not at all obvious that you have become a subscriber. I object to this questionable concealment and found on my account the way of cancelling my subscription, which was obtained by dubious means. The company need to make this clearer or risk being reported to the regulator ( I say this as a retired company chairman ). Well done Trust Pilot. Thank you for your reply Lorna - see below. The problem is that if you block the e mails, which in some respects are very irritating, then you fail to realise that further charges are going to be made. As we can see the company is going to maintain it position, which I believe to be unreasonable.

We spend time making an online order only to be told that we have already had a voucher (years ago) so the voucher we sent you can't be used.

NakedWines	GB	Not bad.	01 September 2021	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	I tried it last week and the wines arrived within a couple of days (impressive) I'd say one of them is good wine and i probably would pay 12 to 15 pounds but the rest are 3.99 wines of Australia. Still not a bad deal. But it's not a bargain.
NakedWines	GB	A1 customer service	30 August 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	A brilliant and effective response when a delivery was partially incorrect. Judge businesses by how they respond when things don’t go to plan. Speedy response over a bank holiday and problem solved. THANKS great job.

NakedWines	GB	Be warned there are ongoing fees and not easy to canc	28 August 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	"Signed up, it was sort of suggested that I would become a member after 30 days no indication that I would be charged or of an amount. Went on the website twice in that 30 days saw nothing indicating I would be charged for anything, so left it thinking it was fine and I had understood correctly there was no ongoing fee after the initial order. Until an email came the day before I was apparently going to be charged £25. Absolutely no obvious way on the website to cancel this ""membership"" and the contact us feature on the site doesn't appear to work. What a con, no excuse for not having a clear and easy way to cancel in my opinion"

NakedWines	GB	Hopeless when something goes wrong	27 August 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	"Having used them for a while (£50/month angel), I was sent a bottle of corked wine.  Fair enough it happens. They advertise a ""no quibble refund guarantee"".  But it isn't as simple as that.  Bryony at NW messages me to tell me that my wine can't be corked.  I tell her that it is and offer to send it back to NW.  Then she tells me to send the batch label on the bottle, which I do.  Then she tells me to write a review before she can do a refund, which I do.  Then she tells me that she can't see my review.  At this point I have lost all patience and have cancelled my account.  ""No quibble refund"" my eye.EDIT: @ Karl The emails from your colleague Bryony  are beyond belief annoying and irritating.  Classic ""non-apologies"".  I do not want or need a replacement bottle.  All I want is for current and future orders to be cancelled and a refund and the account closed, as previously requested.SECOND EDIT: You would think that cancelling an order and getting a refund would be a simple process but apparently not as another case was delivered today."

NakedWines	GB	In tune & down to earth	24 August 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I've loved shopping with Naked Wines and joined them during one of many lockdowns.  Their down to earth approach, fun attitude (they don't take themselves too seriously) all make for a wholesome shopping experience.  Add humorous emailings, direct communications from winegrowers and the regular free gift of a bottle of wine and you are set for a really enjoyable experience.  A unique one at that because of the way they (with the help of amazing algorithms, I'm sure) tune in to you and the wine you buy.  Don't worry about having to sign up for £20 a month.  You can cancel at anytime but I suspect once you've enjoyed the Naked Wine's experience you won't want to.

Really don’t understand the negative reviews about being signed up as an Angel, and the £25 taken each month. It’s pretty clearly stated, and you get to redeem the £25 when ever you want! Great discounts given and the odd freebie. What’s not to love?
NakedWines	GB	Fab refreshing customer service	16 August 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	"Fab service. Really wonderful workers too. I ordered a case with a promo code I received in a moving home box. Delivery quick. Wine delicious. I've seen bad reviews here because it signs you up as an ""Angel"" and takes £25 a month into a pot for you to spend on wine. This is really clear when you use the codes so those buyers below clearly didn't read the terms nor any or the pop ups/emails. However, you can cancel being an Angel as soon as you've used it, either yourself or by emailing the naked wines team, so there's no supscription or money taken - so don't let the bad reviews about this below put you off, just learn how to read ;)"

But it took me about 8 clicks (Profile, My Account, Angel, Cancel, no, no, no, click).It seems a little underhanded to me, which is not what the company *appears* to be all about."

NakedWines	GB	Some very poor wines	05 August 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Five bottles of my first batch from nakedwines are not much good - in fact they are quite awful. During the winter I live in Lanzarote, and can buy better wines in a grocery supermarket much lower prices - none of the five I've tried so far from nakedwines are of a quality that would be sellable for 3 Euros or more over there, and one that is far better than any of the five I've tried so far is sold for 75 cents for a 750ml bottle.
NakedWines	GB	Sceptical. …	04 August 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I was sceptical having experienced Wine clubs in the past. I've been totally blown away by the quality of the wines on offer.

NakedWines	GB	Shocking - promise the earth - deliver the wrong wine	03 August 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Shocking. They claim to know wines! Asked for 6 reds as part of the initial offer.

When I complained they took ages to respond and didn’t go out of their way to put things right. Very disappointed.

I probably would’ve sporadically ordered more if the next month I didn’t get charged £25.00 with no prior knowledge of it. Not a ‘one off’ as they claim, very sneaky!

NakedWines	GB	Charging monthly for a one off!!	29 July 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	After ordering some wine during the last lockdown, I realised that Naked Wines had actually started taking a monthly fee from my card without permission.The worst thing is, you can't actually get in contact with them about the issue as they have no email, the phones ring out and of course the Live Chat is just an automated bot.I would certainly not purchase anything from Naked Wines ever again, and please do think twice before you place an order - and make sure you have enough for them to take it each month!
NakedWines	GB	Wedding Wine	28 July 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I have been a Naked angel for many many years and when my daughter decided to get married I contacted them to source the wine and fizz for the wedding.  The service I received first from Dan and then from Alice, their wine guru was second to none and the price was even better, as I received both my Angel discount and a bulk buy discount on all the wine.  The wine, of course was excellent, having chosen our favourite South African white and red from Stephen de Witt's Arabella vineyard.  It always goes down well and ha the added personal touch for us as my daughter is a keen amateur long distance rider! Both types of fizz recommended by Dan and Alice were excellent too!  n Alice even sent 3 bottles of Katie Jones Me an Monsieur Jones Blanc as my daughter has just become Mrs Jones!  So thank you Naked and Alice for making playing a great part in making their day perfect (and it was, even the weather!)
NakedWines	GB	Be very aware of what you sign up to.	28 July 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I recently signed up to buy a half case of wine from Nakedwines.com. I searched and searched trying to find out if I was signing up to something other than buying the first lot. I have eventually got the details by searching in various aces to amass all the required info. It would be so some to have a few lines of text right at the start to explain how it all works. I'm not the only one that feels this way. You think you're buying a single batch which you pay for before delivery but about a month later they take an amount £20-25 from your credit card, which is held in your piggy bank, each month the same thing happens again. They do say they'll message you to tell you before it's taken but I can't verify as I've cancelled. If you buy £100 of wine, after any discounts, then you seem to get a free bottle, so this could be possible £130 or more, less the discount. The payment will be taken from the piggy bank. I would assume if it's more than you have then your credit card would be used, but again I can't confirm as it's almost impossible to find the details of how it all works. I've known people who thought they got a case each month for the £20-25 taken, that is not the case, but why can't they show simple instructions before you buy that first case? I cancelled because they don't. The second reason is they say you can't buy these wines anywhere else. True enough. Just as you can't buy a major supermarkets wine with their name on anywhere else. But you can buy a Chardonnay, pinot grigio etc elsewhere, and to my mind they're equally as good and similarly priced, or cheaper, without locking money in a piggy bank. Having said that, they say you can withdraw your own money when you like, but I prefer to put my cash in bank, investments, or even my own piggy bank and buy my own choice of wine whenever I choose rather than stuck in someone else's company and pick what they sell or have to get my money back off them. Some of what I bought is already out of stock so even if I stayed and wanted more I either can't or may have to wait.

NakedWines	GB	Terrible delivery service	24 July 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I've been an Angel with Naked wines for a few years and have always enjoyed the choices of wines.More than a week ago I ordered a case of wine, to be delivered the next day. It didn't arrive. I complained and was assured that the case would be delivered in a day or two. The case never arrived. I complained. This time i was told that there was a problem with Yodel not being able to scan the case. I was then promised that as compensation I would have an extra bottle put in my case to be delivered today (24 July 2021)...this morning I was told that the case hadn't been loaded onto the delivery system and would be delivered in a few days time...Naked Wines 'wine guys'....wakey wakey, you really need to sort out your customer relations and delivery companies...you have lost me as a  customer, even though your wines are good your service is terrible....and this isn't the first time that this has happened to me either. Sad, but now off to a more reliable company. Brian Harris
NakedWines	GB	Nice	23 July 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Nice, it’s easy to order
NakedWines	GB	Good wine , a little shaky on customer fulfilment	22 July 2021	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	The wine is good quality, but the delivery less so. Ever since I joined over a year ago, every order has come accompanied with a warning that due to ‘high demand ‘ they cannot offer their ‘usual’ next day delivery. I think the time has come for naked wines to stop pretending , and to accept they do not have the staffing levels needed for consistent next day delivery.Even allowing for the usual warning about high demand, my last order was not dispatched when the company said it would be (something went wrong at the warehouse  apparently), so it was sent out a day late . And that is when there are really problems. The carrier used by Naked Wines in the UK for delivery is Yodel. And Yodel are an unreliable company. One of their failings is claiming to deliver things when they have not.  Of course naked wines redeliver missing wines, but that’s not the point . You have to go through all the bother of chasing it up and getting an explanation from Yodel, and explaining to naked wines that contrary to what yodel claim, the wine was not delivered. I don’t enjoy having to complain in order to get what I paid for. I really don’t enjoy having to deal with Yodel , a company who, I am sorry to say, have a fluid relationship with the truth.So naked wines are overstretched and are being dragged down by the terrible courier they use . I wonder if they are growing a bit to fast and losing customer service focus as they do so?A shame as the underlying idea and product are good. I hope the company sort themselves out, and I will be staying with them for now. But if ordering from them continues to be stressful and frustrating, then I will look elsewhere.
NakedWines	US	Bad wines but at least a few years back, great customer service.	22 July 2021	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	I tried naked wines a few years back because of an app.  I have to say that I hated the taste of every single wine, all I can remember is SOUR..guess some people like that but I did NOT!  The wines themselves got a one star but I've given Naked Wines a two because I was refunded for every single one of them.  I don't know if thats still their policy but for me it worked out great.  I have nothing good to say about the actual wines or how that my tastes and preferences were not addressed in their quiz or survey and sending out wines that YOU believe we will like nonetheless is not the way to earn long lasting customers but you honored your (at least back then) price guarantee to refund any wines that were distasteful so that really counts for something.  If there was even one bottle that I could say was GOOD and not just tolerated I would have given a 3 star rating but the point of drinking wine is to get bottles that you enjoy.  I hope you have taken that into account at this point and make make a survey that really addresses the needs and wants of your customers, if you have I might visit your site in the future. (I had to look up my order # and I also have to say that I appreciated the feedback from the wine producers..I personally did not like the wines and I don't think my preferences were addressed but if you still honor your money back guarantee..which it seems like you do..I think that earns another star!)

NakedWines	GB	There has to be a strong element of hit…	20 July 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	There has to be a strong element of hit and miss when ordering wines from small producers and when information about them and their output is of necessity limited.  Yet in my experience with Naked Wines in over a year every purchase has been a hit.  That's a remarkable strike rate and I'm a very satisfied customer.
NakedWines	US	Just a shout-out about a service that works	20 July 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Just a shout-out about a service that actually works as advertised. I am neither sophisticated nor utterly ignorant about wine, but the bottles I have received were all good, and some were excellent. What prompts me to write, though, is that they fixed a big problem with no screwing around. My first order went well, so I went big with a dozen bottles on the second order. Unfortunately, it was murderously hot when the wine was delivered and it sat in the truck all day. Every bottle but one spoiled and was totally undrinkable (we tried them all). Naked Wines made good immediately...gave me a total credit with no pushback. Very impressive. That quickly, I'm a loyal customer. [Third order was perfect, by the way].
NakedWines	GB	Amazing.	19 July 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Amazing wines, website, service and a whole experience that teaches you about the product. Loving my membership and discovering some fantastic wine. And not forgetting the first-class freebies. Thank you Naked!
NakedWines	GB	Don’t be conned!	19 July 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I recently posted on trust-pilot my experiences using a £75.00 coupon from a completely unrelated purchase. It was a complete fiasco of misinformation which I relayed to Naked Wines, they were good enough to respond, albeit with the usual platitudes and excuses, after a lengthy explanation of my concerns,(because  I wanted to alert others of this so called free offer),  to the fact that this is in fact, as so many others have recorded here, a tie in into a £25.00 a month scam. I was told by them it was easy to opt out, So I put it to the test by putting  in my details on Naked Wines Site, no card numbers were entered because this was an excerise in trying to remove all my details without Naked Wines intervention, ( and I’m not that stupid!), Almost impossible! and I had to contact them by email to ask them to remove all my details. They did with little hassle, I couldn’t find how to remove my information using their sites information, the so called bots are useless, unless your spending! and I’m sure a customer can only apply to this company for deletion. Another hurdle to jump if your putting in your card details. You CANT reverse it without Naked Wines agree to do so for you. Spookily my previous Trust Pilot reviews were also deleted when I asked to have my details removed from Naked Wines site, so my previous encounter has been deleted/ hidden from public view. Dodgy to say the least!  They have fallen at every fence in customer confidence but I’m guessing they’ll push out their regular polite excuses, and hope we all go away making way for new set of misinformed general public users to find out the hard way. I’d have really liked to be able to report the contrary, but alas I can’t. Be aware your joining a subscription service that regularly fails its customers on every level. Chris Dunn. 👎
NakedWines	GB	Naked Wines, Simply the Best	19 July 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Naked Wines, do what they say on the bottle. My experience today was actually quite joyful! The whole concept is upbeat, positive and inclusive. I am looking forward to sampling new and exciting wines from new and imaginitive wine growers. This is a really brilliant way of enabling new and established wine makers to reach wine lovers. The resulting synergy should help them to continue to produce outstanding wines whilst educating us along the way. I would wholeheartedly recommend Naked Wines to everyone who genuinely cares about the calibre of their wine.
NakedWines	GB	Interesting selection of wines..	19 July 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Interesting selection of wines... I just drink Australian and very interested to support new growers.
NakedWines	GB	A dishonest venture...	19 July 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	The price of the introductory wines is great, and they're probably decent wines too.  Unfortunately however, there is no option to choose a preferred palette, only the choice of 'white' 'red' or 'mixed'.  I personally found the wines very acidic and difficult to drink and I wouldn't pay full price for these.When you join you are told that you can choose when you want to order, but they sneakily start to take money from your account on a monthly basis, which is corrupt and which I did not agree to.  Hence I would like to warn people to steer clear of this site, or at least if you don't like the wine, remember to cancel the membership which you didn't know you had signed up to, or at what cost.
NakedWines	GB	Terrible customer service	18 July 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	In the past I would have highly recommended this company, the wines I've had have been lovely. However customer service is now abismal. Over 2 weeks ago they sent 4 bottles of wine that were wrong in my case. Eventually they picked up the wine after very poor communication. That was over a week ago and I have heard nothing more from them, no acknowledgement that they have received the wine they sent that was wrong and no indication of when I will get the wine I should have got on the 3rd. Very poor

I was also compensated £10 as a apology which I accepted for future orders.update they have kept to there word and my delivery is out for delivery today even doh it said it be here Monday 😀

NakedWines	GB	I have put 1 star for 1 reason only	16 July 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I have put 1 star for 1 reason only. I received a gift voucher after purchasing a tent. Now I do not drink and normally I throw these vouchers in the bin. This time though I thought I’d use it to give my brother a present  I chose an option of 12 bottles and paid a further £50+ and used my voucher to complete the transaction. My brother gratefully received his gift a few days later and was impressed with the selection, so no issues with this part of the service. However imagine my horror when I noticed that there has been a transaction on my account to  Naked Wines for £25 each month. I did not sign up for this!!!!!!Be careful when using these vouchers and unless you wish to partake in a monthly service ensure that it’s a one off payment.I have now contacted Naked Wines and asked for the £50 which I have in “My Account” at Naked Wines to be refunded and for any payments to be stopped immediately.I will post any updates.

NakedWines	GB	Not great	13 July 2021	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	"I bought a 6 bottle case of wine as there was an offer for 6 bottles for £19.99. To be honest there were issues from the start. A condition of the offer was that I signed up to be an ""angel"" at £25 per month, redeemable against purchases and fair enough, refundable if requested. I cancelled this immediately as I wasn't interested. Call me shallow, but I wanted the offer and then make up my own mind!The wine was late. It was due on the Friday, but wasn't delivered until the Monday. Excuse given was that the courier couldn't find the address and could I provide a landmark nearby to identify the premises (?!?!?!).Anyway the wine arrived on the Monday. I don't want to be mean but nothing special really. I certainly couldn't determine any difference between the wine and a £6 a bottle supermarket wine. I think the best description of all the bottles was that none offended me, but really they tasted almost watery, certainly no body to them. I wouldn't re-buy and certainly not recommend for anything other than taking advantage of an offer.Also I find the marketing misleading. They say that, basically, if you buy cheap wine then the value of the wine is next to nothing because the tax and costs are too high. What they don't mention is that perhaps the supermarkets/wine merchants etc price the wine as loss-leaders to tempt you into the supermarket and perhaps but other things? At the end of the day does it matter? If you like Lambrusco then buy it. I won't be paying more than about £6 a bottle in the future...."

I find the experience of using links from other sites and also a recent voucher code I got extremely indirect and dishonest. I was about to use a voucher just now and it seemed like a strange process, so had a quick look online and it's apparently a scam that signs you up for regular subscription fee without making that clear at all. Dishonest and indirect and a crapshoot what wines you do get if you signed up.

You got a £75 voucher? You think you are not committed to a monthly fee if you use it? - Think again, you will be tricked into becoming an 'Angle' at £20 or £25 a month subscription and even if you realise that you have been tricked, try and close your account or delete your debit card. The wines are hard to find anywhere else and that is because the suppliers are supported by Naked Wines, it is basically just a rebrand of another named wine. Stick to Morrison or Tescos when they have their 25% off (even on already discounted wine) for every six bottles,  it will be a while before you have tried all of theirs and you will not be conned.

NakedWines	GB	No Angel!	10 July 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I found this online vintner's after noticing their name in a line-up of the UK's top 10 online wine retailers.I wanted to send a wine box to a family member as a gift and was banking on spending up to £150.00 for 6 good bottles of wine.The selection was fantastic but whenever I went to select a bottle I was told that it was only available to 'Angels'. I checked up on their 'Wine Angels' club and found I would have to commit to 'invest' £25 a month. I just wanted to make a one-off purchase! If my experience had been good I'd have probably used them again.I imagine they lose a huge amount of sales by using this daft marketing ploy. I gave them online feedback about this but was totally ignored.

Well... I am a foreigner but still I have understood that if I am going to use the voucher I will become a member and I will pay 25 pounds per month after 30 days. Also you can give up on this and you will have a refund. I did not receive my wines yet (I just ordered) but if is going to be something wrong or everything will be fine I will come back with a new review. Read before order anything. Don't just be happy with a good deal.

NakedWines	GB	Misleading subscription service!!	05 July 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I used an offer provided by an ad campaign through the post. Standard offer of box of wine at a reduced cost, the material seemed to highlight the no ties to subscribing which is why I went ahead with the offer. The following month £25 had been swiftly taken from  my account with no announcement. Very misleading company, just like that word of mouth recommendations have become word of warning.
NakedWines	GB	When UX dark patterns meet bad wine	05 July 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	This is a horrible experience. Top to bottom. Somehow I came across NW in May, I made my first order because I liked the idea of helping the community, etc. I somehow managed to get a voucher and when claiming it, I apparently subscribed to this Angel thing. This morning I woke up with 25 GBP less in my account. When I checked my bank, it seems like they took the same amount last month. Back then I hadn't realised.When I logged into my account it said I have 75 GBP available to spend on wine. When I canceled my account, they said they will refund me only 50 GBP (???).The thing is ... 1. The wine is bad. Supermarket level. At least what I got that first time. That wouldn't really be a problem.but 2. I work in this field. Web experiences are literally my job. Websites are what I do. And even if I am quite aware of a lot of tricks, I got practically tricked into subscribing. These are called DARK PATTERNS (when the user doesn't realise what they are doing because things are not really very clear) and are a shame for the UX community. Not to mention for the business.I would give them -1 star if I could.

So you wait in for the lions share of the day and then get a message saying yodel at not going to deliver today and maybe you'll get your wines on Monday.  Too late to speak to anyone at Naked Wines - you can drive yourself insane with their robotised chat bot.  They don't ask you if a delivery on Monday - well after the wine tasting you planned is acceptable and you couldn't tell them even it is isn't.  A good company for wine but sadly fail on delivery and customer service.

NakedWines	GB	Sadly Cancelled Order - No Flexibility	02 July 2021	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	I had considered NW for some time and bit the bullet on seeing a facebook ad with a GR8 offer. It wasn't clear from the ad that it was a subscription and very unlike me I read the smallprint. I ended up on live chat with the Bot which was useless and finally spoke to a real person. She was lovely I explained I was more Diablo than Angel and just wanted to try their wine to make my own judgement before committing. She was able to find me a voucher and a case, the deal was still good but not quite as good as the Ad offer. GR8, Order Made and confirmed.  NO wine Order cancelled. Reason, my partner and I have a shared credit card, same details etc and she previously had ordered and registered the card some time ago although she cannot remember it. I cannot be certain but the original Ad I think said one voucher/offer per person not per household. NW couldn't sort their admin out I wonder if the outcome would have been different had i signed up to be an Angel?Now reading some of these reviews I would say Slick marketing that is not always as transparent as you would like with pleasant polite staff once you get through to them.Sorry I don't seem to be able to reply to the reply from NW. Corrine you don't seem to get it. I have a shared Credit Card with my partner. It has the same number etc but has my name and her name on separate cards. This is the first time in 20years that it can't be used with the same vendor. Often we are asked for the name on the card as well as the details but it has never been refused on these grounds.

NakedWines	GB	Excellent wine, brilliant service and supporting the smaller vineyards!	01 July 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I've been a member/Angel with Naked wines for many years and before that I supported Orgasmic Wines - the main reason - to support the smaller wineries and wine growers who have the expertise but not always the necessary funding, so we help them. The experience has been excellent - fantastic wines, great, knowledgeable growers and a supplier (Naked) who puts the wine first for its customers..... and then the staff working for Naked are so good - always helpful, always going the extra mile.... we've just ordered our wedding wine from Naked (thru wedding guru Alice) and the service has been brilliant!

Which is why I've been an angel for over a decade.

NakedWines	GB	"Naked Wines - In my opinion ""A cut above the rest""."	01 July 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I have now been using Naked as my preferred supplier of wine for 6 years.  I can categorically say that having used other suppliers, I would not now change.  Nothing is too much for them, comments on poor tasting wine result in an unconditional refund.  I value Nakeds knowledge and bringing the producers into my home via Zoom has introduced me to a whole new world of wine understanding.  Pricing seems to me to be competitive and the range of wines suitable for my needs.  Thank you Naked.

I have never had a poor bottle from Naked and find their advice really helpful.  If a wine I've ordered is out of stock or not available, they will make helpful suggestions based on past orders or on the type of wine originally ordered.I was lucky enough to attend a wine tasting In Newcastle where quite a few of the producers appeared along with plentiful supplies!  It was genuinely heartwarming to understand how Naked's intervention and investment had made a tangible difference to not only the winemakers but also their local communities because of increased opportunities.I can thoroughly recommend joining Naked to anyone thinking about buying wine online.

NakedWines	GB	The best wine club for sure….	30 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	There is no better wine philosophy out there better than naked in my opinion. I have been an angel since they started and enjoy some incredible wines, knowing that I am supporting small independent wine makers and vineyards around the world and getting something that is not available in a supermarket. The stories and narrative behind each and every wine grower is captivating and at times humbling for sure.Love the free bottle every month and the amazing christmas case and never have a case without a ‘me & monsieur Jones by Katie Jones or a white from Rod Easthope. This is a club that I admire and have no doubts that I will be with as long as they continue doing their stuff. It’s for you if you enjoy engaging with others, both members and the winemakers themselves, love a variation of top quality wine and learning about wine as you go along..Ive seen some poor reviews recently but in my experience they are always approachable and eager to sort out any issues and I’ve always been more than happy with the way they have been resolved. Top company in my opinion

NakedWines	GB	It is subscription based, so don't get sucked in !	30 June 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Why does this company hide the fact that IT IS A SUBSCRIPTION BASED ACCOUNT, that is until you have been drawn in with their special offer and you receive a card saying thank you for joining us and your monthly payment is £25 ???????????? it is put as this would be the amount you will spend on wine in a month so give it to us instead and buy our wine !Update: it a shame that Trustpilot does not allow you add documents as I wanted to show the documents that came with the wine to illustrate that it does not mention a monthly payment until you receive a post card (another document I wanted to attach) about a week after the wine arrived which does ask you to deposit £25, which is yours to spend on any wine you want !

NakedWines	GB	STOP If you're buying wine anywhere else!	30 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	If you're buying your wine anywhere else STOP!Yes the wines are great... yes they're priced well, yes the selection is excellent, yes the service is top notch.....but that's not all. Its something you get invested in. You have some connection to the origins of your wines and the vineyard owners. You look forward to a new batch of your favourites (pre ordered or course!).This is wine buying at its best. I am not easily pleased and yet reading this may lead you to think I have some ulterior motive or have low standards. I don't I assure you, except beyond ensuring they keep going and growing (in every sense) so I get the wonderful wines my wife and I love. And then there's the Christmas box..... join and get one for this year. STUPENDOUS!Did I say highly recommended?!

Based on what I’ve previously ordered they recommend wines, as in ‘You’ll like this, or ‘Not sure’ whenever I scroll through the available wines to make up my case.I love their ethos, supporting new wine producers and that through their endeavours I can help to feed and support children in need.Their telephone advisors are super friendly and helpful. In fact, they’re an outstanding Company.

NakedWines	GB	Experience of a Naked Angel	30 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	"I've been with Naked for many years and they have never failed to provide me with some interesting wines at realistic prices.  In particular the Christmas offer has been great!I have recently signed up for the ""Fine Wine"" offer: more expensive wines each quarter - too early to comment but I am looking forward to the result.I have been particularly impressed with their actions on the very rare occasions that a delivery has run into a problem - once a wine that was ""spoiled"" and another occasion when a bottle was missing.  They rapidly accepted the position and refunded me for the bottle(s)."

Delivery has been consistently excellent - either on time or early with good communications. Regular wine tastings and interviews with the growers online provide additional interest . Range of wines and opportunities to try different grapes ( some of which are now favourites) are a big plus. Customer service is excellent ( only had to contact once ).I’m a very happy customer and hope to continue for many years!

For example, the feedback and connection with different wine makers, their wines and their stories. It's nice to think that through our Angel subscriptions we're pre-financing their businesses, and receiving a discount on the cost of wines when later purchased. Expectedly, some wines are better than others. Unexpectedly, all the wines are good...mostly very good. The best wine club by far - and I've been a member of several over the years. Well done Naked Wines!

I have not been disappointed with any of my choices, some I have preferred to others but none have been disappointing. I try to keep my choices to under £12 because every one wants that super wine at a bargain price. I am safe in the knowledge that should I want to leave Naked Wine I can do so anytime and get a full refund of any balance in my account. I love the fact that we Angels are helping small vineyards that cannot compete with the big wine producers.

NakedWines	GB	12 months in and very happy!	30 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I started using naked wines around 12 months ago as a way to have wine delivered to my house, I didn't realise when I first started how much it would change the type of wine that I buy and how much I appreciate the wine that I'm drinking.Through naked wines community and speaking with other customers and the winemakers directly I have tried all manner of grape varieties from locations that I had never purchased wine from previously. You can use naked wines as just catalogue for wine, you can purchase it as and when you want to but there is also a community aspect it that you can choose to engage in as little or as much as you like. That's been really helpful in fostering my enjoyment of wine and informing my purchases. The quality of wine available for naked wines is higher than that I've been used to purchasing from supermarkets at a similar price point, generally starting around £6 to £7 per bottle purchasing bottles at this price point gets you some fantastic wine exclusive to naked wines.I now regularly purchase bottles between 7 and 10 pounds a bottle and there's great choice and phenomenal quality at this price point, in over 6 cases there has only been one bottle I wasn't very keen on and naked wines will refund you the money for that no questions asked if you are not completely satisfied. Your subscription with naked wines goes into your wine account there isn't a charge as such for being a member, just you pay £20 per month and when you are ready you use that money to pay for your wine. Should you want to pause the subscription you are free to and should you wish to end the subscription you are free to add any time, no contracts. I have introduced family and friends to nakedwines many of whom have continued to purchase from them.

NakedWines	GB	Making a difference by drinking great wines	30 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	"I really like this wine club. Initially just did it as an easy way of saving up for Xmas drinks but now I order all year round, even topping up on my account.Some of the wines might appear expensive but they're no more than you would pay in a restaurant and usually much much better in both taste and quality. I do have my ""old faithfuls"" but love trying out new suggestions based on my preference profile.Not every wine has been to my taste, but you can always get a refund if you don't like a particular one, which gives me a reassurance that I can't really go wrong. The sense of helping smaller growers or vintners as well as charities and communities really appeals to me and it's easy to find out more of how I'm making a difference through the app or website or the regular updates. I've even had a personal message from one of the producers (the wine was amazing!)All in all good value for money"
NakedWines	GB	No complaints. Reccomend	30 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I find Naked Wines to be an excellent online service with no hassles attached. Good service with informative emails every so often so when you do get an email you tend to read it unlike other sites who bombard you daily.Great selection of wine which i am currently working through the cheaper whites and reds and find them to be very good and better than what i can get from my local supermarket on a price by price comparison. Delivery is good with no issues to date although they did deliver a day early once with no notice. Luckily i was in so a bit of a boost before the weekend. Would highly recommend
NakedWines	GB	My sole source of wine now!	30 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Very good range of wines backed up by reliable delivery, lots of informative, high quality wine makers and a bottle refund offer if it is not as you expected.

A couple of the bottles, an Arabella chenin balance and an Italian organic Pinot Grigo were absolutely wonderful, gorgeous. However one bottle of Chenin blanc was so vile we threw it away in the end, just very sour and nasty. We still have three more to try, hopefully they will be as delicious as the first two.
NakedWines	GB	Naked Wines is awesome	30 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Since my first order more than 5 years ago, Naked Wines have introduced me to numerous fabulous wines and wine makers I would otherwise never have heard. Having graduated to become an Angel, the process of selecting and purchasing has been made even more satisfying by having not only a great discount but an account balance that grows each month so my purchase costs are more manageable. As a means of getting cash to winemakers, I think Naked Wines is a stroke of genius and am glad to be part of the Angel community.

NakedWines	GB	Cancelling subscription	29 June 2021	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	I’ve been an Angel of Naked Wines for probably about 6 years and have stuck with them because I liked the ethos.However I am due to get married soon and thought we would do our wines through Naked, especially given we have been customers for so long I thought they would jump at the chance. A service they supposedly offer… but after 3 emails, 2 calls and 1 response after all that chasing, that I’ve now not had a response to for over a week, I have to say I’m done. My original ask was back last year sometime. I will be cancelling my subscription because I think the service is shocking now. Nobody follows up when they say they do. Don’t offer a wine service if you have no intention of giving people wines. Especially for a special occasion service!
NakedWines	GB	Just brilliant	29 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I have been Naked for 12 years now. What's not to love? Wine is always top quality and no quibble replacements/refunds if not (only ever disliked 2 bottles and they were refunded immediately). Top quality wine at the right price - you can decide what price you want to pay, there's always a range for all pockets! Not only is the wine great quality, the community is awesome - getting to know the winemakers makes a significant difference to your wine making decisions - you can buy from people you meet, like and trust. I'm in other faceless wine clubs, but Naked takes 90% of my investment in wine enjoyment.
NakedWines	GB	Great way to explore a wider range of wines	29 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Great way to explore a wider range of wines and discover excellent winemakers. On average the wines will cost a few pounds a bottle more than cheap supermarket options, but are a world apart in quality. Building a more personal connection to the wine makers is also invaluable.
NakedWines	GB	Naked Wines have proven an excellent provider	29 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I have been with Naked Wines about a year now and have been very happy. I like the ethos of working with small specialist and boutique vitners especially, and the wines are a joy to drink.Best of all, we get to try things which we wouldn't have otherwise experienced, and it has greatly improved our enjoyment - and educated our pallet too. The only downside is I am much fussier now, and that usually translates to pricier wines - but at least Naked Wines makes that less 'painful'.I have actively recommended it to friends - only to find some already use them - which usually starts a conversation about how good they are ...

NakedWines	GB	Supporting independent wine growers and producers	29 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I love that Naked Wines support independent wine growers and the quality of the wines (and cider) I have ordered over the last year have been excellent and additionally, good value for money. It is also heart warming to see, particularly during Covid, how these wine growers are integral to their local communities and have rallied to help those less fortunate than themselves. If you enjoy great wine, are interested to understand more about its origins and importantly support those producing it, then I absolutely recommend you try ordering from Naked Wines.
NakedWines	GB	Great company	29 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I’ve been with Naked Wines for over a year now and so glad I joined. I’m really liking trying different wines and it’s good to know that you’re supporting small vineyards and winegrowers especially during what has been a challenging time for many of them during the pandemic.  I’ve enjoyed their regular zoom sessions and meeting some of the winemakers virtually and hearing about different wines.

NakedWines	GB	An excellent company to purchase wine from	29 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I have been shopping with Naked wines for over 6 months now... I have found them an excellent company to purchase from: the website is informative,  easy to use and based on previous purchases and reviews makes good suggestions about wines that I will like. The range is excellent and so far every wine I have purchased has been excellent.  The prices are very good for such good quality wines, and there are options to buy lower cost wines or high end wines for special occasions.  There is also the added bonus of knowing that Naked Wines takes an interest in the wine makers that they purchase from and have helped many small producers to get through difficult times.  The customer service is absolutely amazing: I live in a remote part of the UK (on a Scottish Island)and so delivery is never as prompt as on the mainland, but whenever Naked Wines feels that there may have been a delay in my delivery they are pro active: emailing me to assure me that they are checking the tracking of my delivery.  It is always nice to know that they value my custom and are ensuring that my wine has arrived safely.  I would award Naked Wined 6 stars if it were possible!!

I am sure in your email to me you offered me a good bottle of wine.
NakedWines	GB	Great service and good wines	28 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Always a great service with good quality wines at affordable prices.
NakedWines	GB	Beautiful wines not had one bad bottle	28 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Beautiful wines not had one bad bottle. A fine range with excellent customer service
NakedWines	GB	just my kind of wine merchant.  Maybe yours too.	28 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Have been with Naked wines for few years now.  The wines are excellent, with plenty of choice.  Delivery is usually prompt, was a bit of a problem in the early stages of Covid, but understandably.  Prices are probably appropriate to the quality of the wine.  Service is great.  No quibble refunds if you don't like the wines.  If they make a mistake and send you the wrong bottle, you don't pay but keep the wrong bottle anyway.  One nice thing is a connection with the winemakers.  Those that you follow send out regular postings,  and when you rate their wines, they often respond with a suggestion or thanks for the comments.One feature i like is that they let you build up a wine fund, whereby you pay in a regular amount each month to build up your pot and when you want to buy some wine, you buy it from the pot.  They then also use this built up cash to support the winemakers, and then each month there is a freebie wine, frequently a magnum or 2 bottles, that you can take if you buy another dozen.  If the wines you buy are over £100, the £7 postage is free.There is absolutely no tie in apart from the wines and the service.  You can spend or cash in your pot whenever you want.Definitely recommended.
NakedWines	GB	Glad to have joined	28 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	As a new customer and having never before bought wine from a specialist supplier, I went for one of the pre-selected boxes and can honestly say there wasn’t a bottle that I didn’t like. I like the principle of supporting small independent vineyards and whenever you review a wine the maker responds to your comments. When it came time to order more, because of the regular monthly payment system, I’d got a nice little amount in the pot towards the cost of the next case, removing any guilt I might have felt about my extravagance. Really pleased to have subscribed to Naked Wines.
NakedWines	GB	Excellent service	28 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Excellent service, wines and ethics. Spot on!
NakedWines	GB	A happy Naked Wines Angel😊	28 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I have used Naked Wines for quite a long time and have always been happy with the wines they supply. The quality of their wine is invariably good and I rarely buy wine from anywhere else as I am sure to be completely satisfied with what they send me. The service and delivery too is always quick and reliable.

NakedWines	GB	Naked Wines have excelled at every juncture.	28 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Naked Wines have excelled at every juncture.  They take notice of your order history and are brilliant at suggesting wines to your taste.  Their dispatch of your order is first rate and coupled with a very good delivery company makes for a premium service.   The selection of wine makers is of particular note, Naked Wines selects and invests in many up and coming vintners around the world helping them to get their wines to market. I have subscribed to two other wine clubs in the past but Naked Wines has surpassed them both.   Having enjoyed several complimentary bottles of beautiful red wines I highly recommend this company.

NakedWines	GB	Naked Wines are good	28 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I have subscribed to Naked Wines for a number of years now and I am delighted with my experience. I have not received a bad bottle of wine in all this time. I used to buy my wine from Waitrose but have found Naked to be better quality and better value. I pay a monthly amount into my Naked Wine account and when I am ready I order the wine I want; this could be a standard case put together by Naked or a case I put together. If I have the money in my account that’s fine if there isn’t enough to cover it I pay the difference. If you order enough bottles delivery is free and there is usually a free bottle too. You will not be sent any wine automatically each month so there is no issue of continually cancelling dispatches etc. This was important to me, I didn’t want any pressure to continually respond to prevent unwanted deliveries being sent. I could write more but in summary I can recommend Naked Wines.

NakedWines	GB	Highly recommended.	28 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	We've been a Naked customer since 2010 and very rarely have we been disappointed with a wine, and the few occasions when the wine was below par, they were quickly credited without any quibble.  Naked continues to be a great place to buy wine. Via the monthly Angel payment scheme, we love the support Naked Wines gives to small independent growers, especially through the pandemic, who produce some seriously great wine but would struggle to compete through the supermarkets.  Highly recommended.
NakedWines	GB	Are you ready for a taste explosion?	28 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I have been a Naked Wine angel for quite a while and I have never been disappointed.  The wines are superb, the deliveries are always on time and the customer service is brilliant.  It has taken me out of my comfort zone because the wines are more expensive than the mass produced wines that I have usually chosen, because they are reliably the same as always, but it has been a brilliant adventure, trying wines that are new to me, from places I had only read about.  I'm glad too, that I am helping to support vineyard owners to know that they have a ready market for their product i.e. Naked Wines.

They help wine growers who are starting out to grow their market. You can have as much or as little as you want and they very often send a free bottle to try. They also help youngsters in the developing world to learn about wine growing by giving grants. So far we have NOT had a bottle we couldn't drink so I heartily recommend them.

NakedWines	GB	Excellent all round	28 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Excellent range of wines to suit all tastes / price ranges. Absolutely no pressure to buy on a monthly basis your money just goes onto your account to use when you want. If you are unfortunate enough to get a wine which isn't right a replacement / refund is offered straightaway which is very refreshing.  Delivery is more often than not quick even through lockdown so we may not have gotten our groceries but at least we had plenty of wine 😂. Its also nice to know you are helping out the smaller businesses. I'm afraid Naked has made me a bit of a wine snob even though I usually stick to the cheaper bottles unless I buy a case as the wine I used to get with my weekly shop just doesnt do it for me anymore even though I loved it before trying Naked.

NakedWines	GB	Good wines, better prices and great customer service	28 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Since the pandemic began, we've bought all our wines from Naked Wines. I'm finding that they are better quality wines than we've been buying from shops ikn the past and it's easier, say, to buy a bottle of red with a few years in the bottle, which is great, as that is something which has frustrated me in the past.The 'Angel's prices' are very fair and the wine represents very good value. It has always been delivered on time and the delivery driver is very friendly.Every so often there's a reward: an extra bottle of something nice, for example, which is very welcome.I would hesitate to recommend this service to my friends (in fact, I have to several and they are as happy as I am).

Since joining we have sampled a whole range of wines that we would otherwise not have the confidence to buy. Whenever there is an issue they always deal with it quickly with some kind of recompense- extra bottles in the case etc. I totally recommend Naked Wine to those who want to get out of the rut of drinking the same supermarket wine week in, week out!

NakedWines	GB	13 years Naked & no complaints	28 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I’ve been with Naked since late 2008, a few weeks after its creation. Overwhelmingly positive feedback from me, I’ve had great wines, great service & there’s a really lovely community of drinkers out there.The biggest drawback for some is their use of Yodel. I came a cropper once or twice when living up in Preston, but over 10+ years in Bristol, service has been great.In sum, definitely worth giving Naked a try! It’s proper lush, & great knowing they look after their winemakers 👍👍

NakedWines	GB	Naked Tipple	28 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I’ve been a member of Naked Wines now for more than 10 years and in that time I have never had reason to complain about the quality or the price of the wines. I’m not a massive wine drinker and recent health problems have meant I am drinking even less but there is absolutely no pressure on you to keep buying  and I still buy as and when I want. What ever your taste, whether it is white or rose or red there is something for everybody and if you are not sure then the mixed cases that they put together are good value for money and offer a good  choice of different wines. I have no hesitation of recommending them.

NakedWines	GB	Naked and proud	28 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Naked Wines have always been brilliant for me. The wines they offer, the prices, the website, the ordering mechanism, the CONCEPT!!!! - invest £20 in independent winemakers AND get to spend the £20 youself too!!! And when I had a problem (with delivery, not with Naked) they offered a couple of free bottles which and sorted the situation. Things can go wrong, but how you deal with the situation defines how good an organisation you are. Naked Wines is superb!

I love knowing my money is going to help fund small vineyards and start ups across the world, AND I get to enjoy these unique wines. I have been a member for over a year now and have not had a bad wine yet! Love the stories around the things naked do to help people, and organisations they work with, such as Carmen Stevens and her organisation helping feed school children. I recommend any and all wine lovers to become a naked angel, you won’t regret it, and you’ll never want to buy another shop bottle again!
NakedWines	GB	Great quality wine at a reasonable price	28 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I don’t buy from Naked Wines every month. I wish I could. The wines are superb quality for the price.

NakedWines	GB	So glad I discovered Naked Wines	28 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	So glad I discovered Naked Wines, they are almost a social enterprise in winemaking. Whilst they're actually not because they do make a profit, they actually do a lot for independent winemakers and when there is a crisis, like the California wildfires or the pandemic in South Africa, they step up to the plate financially, to help and ensure that these independents will survive for all our benefits. By the way did I mention they sell great, tasty wines at fair prices. I would recommend them strongly. I have been an 'Angel' for about 5 years now and never regretted it. I even subscribe to their fine wines club and take delivery of 6 bottles of extra delicious and interesting wines, a few times a year. Go for it, I'm confident you won't regret it. Plus once we get back to normal, if there is ever a Naked Wine Fair in your area then you really should try and get to it, it's amazing to meet the winemakers and sample so many fabulous wines, a really friendly, non intimidating thing to do.

NakedWines	ES	New to Naked in Jan 2021	28 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I joined Naked Wines in January 2021. I chose one of their pre-mixed red and white cases to get me started and all of the wines were very drinkable. Since then I've had a half case of one of the original wines that I particularly enjoyed and which was an excellent price for the quality. My experience of both deliveries was that they came when they said they would. There is no pressure to buy or having to remember to cancel a monthly delivery. Although I haven't made use of it yet the offer of an occasional free bottle is also appealing.I find the website and the app easy to use and I particularly like the Tuesday evening 'zooms' with various winemakers. I hope that will continue in the future. I'm pleased to be able to support independent wine makers.

NakedWines	GB	Naked wines business model is very…	28 June 2021	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	Naked wines business model is very simple. They set fictitious, crazy high prices which are nowhere near reality. They then set another total fantasy discounted price to make you believe you are getting a fantastic offer. You can buy these wines cheaper online without any commitment whatsoever. They create feelgood stories about the growers to play up the value. Its just hot air. When you trawl the net for reviews, you will see that most people will not order the same wines again. Its cheap odd bin plonk dressed up to sound special. Instead of the normal subscription (where you continue to receive cases each month), they instead ask you to invest money against future purchases. Not a scam, but poor value for money and they should be honest regarding the savings or lack of them!

NakedWines	GB	I ordered wine from them exactly once…	25 June 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I ordered wine from them exactly once several months ago and never ever agreed to a subscription. Now I have spotted they have been charging me £20 a month (?!?!) ever since and I'm truly shocked. I have never subscribed to anything.They haven't been notifying me of the charge either as I'm sure they rely on morons like me who catch on their game a little too late. I expect this money to be refunded to me immediately or I'll kick up a legal fuss. Stay away from this company.

NakedWines	GB	Simply wonderful 🍷	25 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Simply wonderful. I am a novice wine drinker and as such know very little about wines, other than whether I enjoy the one I am drinking. Naked wines not only gives me access to wines I wouldn’t otherwise be able to purchase, but also guides me through the journey with hints and tips as to which wines I’m likely to enjoy the most. Saving up every month makes it easier to spread the costs and the reminders about my favourite wines are great to make sure I don’t miss a bottle.

NakedWines	GB	Well what can I say	24 June 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Well what can I say, the journey started off on the wrong foot then the award-winning customer happiness team contrived to make the whole experience just ghastly. From a wrong wine being picked, to not being willing to send out the right one, from refunding the wrong amount to making promises in correspondence that clearly were not understood by the rest of the team - to then continue to refund the wrong amounts into the account - And in-between all of this, then having to deal with a *Bot* who doesn't understand anything other than to tell you it's in training, then calling the customer happiness number on three occasions (during office hours) for it never to be answered apart from a message to tell you when they're open when you're trying to deal with issues really kinda put a lid on it for me...

How wrong was I! I buy too much wine, far too often, have learnt loads and I love it! The emails from Naked and the winemakers are emails I genuinely enjoy reading and the events are such a great way of interacting. The only reason I haven’t given a 5 is that delivery isn’t always convenient whereas I’m sure you used to be able to pick a day.

NakedWines	NZ	Wine offer not what it seems!	18 June 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	"I recieved some advertising materials through my letterbox for Naked Wines. They basically offer 30 pounds off a box of six wines. I decided to accept their offer, but found out when doing so that you have to sign up to payments of 25 pounds a month thereafter. Nowhere in their advertising materials is this stated, in fact on the rear of their marketing ""cheque"", it says ""NO requirement to join any wine ""clubs"""". I consider this misleading at best. It seems like a good idea, and I normally would have gone for it, but I don't like being deceived in this way. Pity."

NakedWines	GB	These Wines are Simply Remarkable	18 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	"It wouldn't surprise those few hundred people who know me to learn that I have drunk a reasonably sized lake of red wine in my lifetime. Albeit in something of a haze which dates back to the 1970's I can relate to ""I know nothing about art but I know what I like"" and apply it to wine. So here goes: Anyone who does not think these wines aren't the most fabulous quality at a reasonable price are either mad or beer drinkers. These wines are simply remarkable."
NakedWines	GB	The Naked Family	18 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I have found being part of the Naked Wine Family is much more than just buying wine on-line.

NakedWines	GB	Fantastic company	18 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Fantastic companyIt's quite expensive so it's not something that I'll be ordering regularly from but I found a voucher/flier in some goods I'd ordered and gave it a whirl.Good easy to understand website.Ordered 14 bottles - why I didn't order 15 I don't know but there you go.Delivery tracker from yodel to stalk when it's coming.Unfortunately issues with the delivery outside of Naked Wines control however this was swiftly sorted out by them with regular communication and fantastic outcome from them.Any company can take your money/order but it takes a great company that truly cares about its customers and takes its customer service seriously.Well done and thanks again for everythingX
NakedWines	GB	Love Naked wines	18 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Love Naked wines. We have never had a bad bottle of wine from them. Each bottle taste so good. I also like that they don't bombard you with daily emails pressuring you to buy like other companies.
NakedWines	GB	Great source of interesting wines	18 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Naked wines is a great source of out of the ordinary, interesting wines from all over the world. The stock changes frequently and there are always temptations. Prices are very reasonable and the whole business of ordering and delivery is carried out smoothly and efficiently. We have had some outstanding wines from Naked and all this is coloured by the knowledge that small independent growers and wine makers are benefitting. There is also significant charitable activity, helping children of wine workers in South Africa (for example).As an added delight, the Christmas hampers are full of great wines and some interesting surprises.I recommend Naked very highly
NakedWines	GB	You Don't Have to be Naked to Enjoy WIne but it Helps!	18 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	We're really enjoying the benefits of this community, which gives access to some great wines from smaller vineyards in return for a regular contribution, which helps support the growers and then offsets the cost of any wine bought.Brilliant and very enjoyable!

It compells you to spend money on alchohol each and every month under the Angels banner!Its also very difficult to spot at inception of the first order and is also difficult to cancel. And now Ive found out what the offer really entails ive also got to face my friends that I recommended. NOT a nice company to deal with. Majestic Wines shop, here I come!!"

NakedWines	GB	Only thing not to love is I didn’t need an excuse to drink more wine!	17 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I stumbled across Naked Wine’s festive box in 2018 and thought - what a great price, I’ll do this for Christmas. What then started is a love affair that has still not ended… it has introduced me to so many delicious wines, that are always just a click away. And with the wine coming from small independent growers, you truly feel part of the journey and that but closer to the whole experience. And when these growers are so truly passionate, it rubs off on you. And then there’s the occasional charity case - like the Australian Wild Fires case. That just give me another (unneeded) excuse to partake. On the one occasion a bottle I received was no good, the customer service was absolutely outstanding and I raved about it for weeks. Completely supercharged my faith that I could trust their selection, knowledge and service. I’ve joined another couple wine clubs, but I have never left naked and come back exclusively as I just love being an Angel!

A great selection of high quality and tasty wines, with good selection for all tastes. In the unusual event of something going wrong, their service recovery is fantastic and customer service team couldn’t be more helpful - amongst the best I’ve ever experienced. My only criticism is their delivery partner, who quite often has delivered on a different day to that promised at the time of booking (often a day early!).

NakedWines	IM	The wines are fabulous	17 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	The wines are fabulous, I've only had a couple of bottles from quite a few cases that I haven't been too keen on. I like that the wines are from smaller vineyards that need support to keep up their good work. Even my husband is impressed and he's not really a wine drinker. I've recommended Naked Wines to friends and relatives, given wine as gifts, gutting when it's your favourite, and everyone loves them. Good customer service and great quality wine at reasonable prices.  Well done.

NakedWines	GB	First class wines and first class service	17 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	First class wines and first class service. I had a couple of minor issues with deliveries which Naked Wines sorted out immediately. We choose red wines as that’s our preferred tipple - some lovely wines and no duds so far! Thoroughly recommend - our wines average about £8 a bottle after the discounts which is probably what we would spend at the off licence for a more generic average red wine.

NakedWines	GB	Naked wine is a great concept	17 June 2021	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	Naked wine is a great concept. Great for trying wines that you would not normally have access to or would normally be drawn too, and great that consumers get to take out the middle man.I do however feel the special offers that Naked wines promote are far more geared to ‘new customers’ not those loyal. For example I received, what I though was a brilliant, promotion through the post last week and when I contacted Naked wines to access the promotion I was told this was for new customers only. A bit rubbish seeing as this was not stated on their letter from them.
NakedWines	GB	Not just a source of excellent wine…	17 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Not just a source of excellent and good value wines. Membership of Naked Wines has opened the door to a whole new relationship with the wine industry which we love. We’ve met winemakers and really understand their passions and their challenges and have felt able to make our purchasing decisions from a much better develop understanding. The service from the Naked Wine team is also excellent; it is great being an “angel”.

NakedWines	GB	Lack of transparency left me feeling I had been scammed	17 June 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Having received a voucher via an unrelated supplier purchase I purchased 6 bottles of wine online. I always read the small print and pride myself in not falling into any hidden commitment traps, but ashamed to say they conned me. Despite no warning that giving my credit card details would result in future unauthorised debits they have taken £25 without my agreement this month. They responded by saying they make it clear at several stages that a subscription debit is agreed by making the wine purchase. No it isn't or it is well hidden, far from transparent and underhand.It may be that the wine is excellent and good value but I have not yet opened any. This review is all about my anger at being scammed. Had they been open and made clear the terms I may well have given it a go, but they did not and I don't do business with such disreputable marketing companies
NakedWines	GB	Satisfied customer	17 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Since joining Naked wine and upgrading to Angel status I am completely happy with the wines, some of which are superb. Delivery is quick and efficient with every order.

NakedWines	GB	Great Company, great customers	17 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I have used Naked since they began and am cery supportive of a company that promotes interesting growers and sells direct.

NakedWines	GB	Great wines, but bad ordering system.	17 June 2021	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	Great wines, but sometimes when you confirm and pay for your order. The wine you want runs out of stock when your order is made up several days later. Your wine should automatically be allocated to your order when your order is confirmed. The warehouse staff seem to be a law until themselves as they send any replacement they choose if a wine runs out of stock.

NakedWines	GB	Lockdown Highlight	17 June 2021	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	I joined Naked Wines in the first lockdown and haven’t looked back. I have enjoyed trying new wines and especially because they are delivered to my door. The wines aren’t cheap but they are great quality and I would spend this amount on good wine anyway. Most of the wines are 14% and I think it would be good if they could add some lower percentage wines to their catalogue. The app is really easy to use and helps you choose wines similar to others you’ve liked. They also pop a freebie in the box most times which is a nice extra. I would recommend joining if you love good wine and don’t want the hassle of going to the supermarket for it. It’s always a pleasure to receive that sturdy box of wine!

NakedWines	GB	Consistently great wine.	17 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	"Consistently great wine.I’ve had the lower cost mixed cases and am a member of the fine wine club and without exception the wines that are picked for me are really great. Even the ones that are not to my taste I can tell that they are still good wines and when that happens we flag it up and the wine is credited back to my account.Although that has only happened maybe 2-3 times in close to 300 bottles delivered.Paying £50 a month is great as well as you log in after 3 months to have a look at the latest mixed case and free gift offer and boom! you’ve got £150 to spend on wine! Winning.There are other great features too, I like the ""you like this wine, would you like to get 6 of the next vintage"" because too often you forget a great wine and don’t get the benefit the next year. I know its a marketing and sales tool but so what, its a win win as in a year you get an email ""your 6 are ready, do you want to top that up to 12 to get your free bottle"". Why yes I do Naked Wines, oh and by the way I’ll use my credit that I’ve accumulated over the last month to pay some of the balance. Win win.Id recommend to anyone to try out all the features of the site."

I 'forget' that I am using a direct debit, then every year/18 months I have a decent amount in my account to choose from amazing wines from around the world. Knowing that, along with other Angels, we are helping small independent wine producers to keep going when maybe they could be struggling, is good. The result is that they get to produce wines that otherwise wouldn't be available, and we get to drink them. Win win!

The only dodgy wine bottle I had (and believe me when I say its a very small percentage) was refunded without question.
NakedWines	GB	Naked Wines are consistently 5-star	16 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Naked Wines supply interesting, delicious good value wines - some are given free, and all are excellent quality.  Any problem with any wine is quickly and sympathetically dealt with through their quality control desk. Their deliveries are always on time and, barring emergencies, are exactly what was ordered. N W is one of the very few companies that I would unhesitatingly recommend to anyone.  Always just as expected - never any hassles.
NakedWines	GB	Quality wine on time and more!	16 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	To receive quality wine on time and at a good price is the service we all want, not only does Naked Wines do this but they also support small independant wine makers whom supply wines of distinction and exceptional quality, 5 stars from me for Naked Wines and their winemakers everytime.

Primarily  I like to experience great quality wines at a reasonable price and with little commitment. Selfish maybe?On the other side Naked Wines provide financial support to young winemakers, who inturn by the nature of their business provide paid employment to people in their local communities. New products are evolving and I, as an Angel, enjoy consuming the very best of the output at very reasonable prices. WHITE, RED OR ROSE you can have your choice. If you have doubts as i did, give  it a try.

NakedWines	GB	Exceptional Experience	16 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I was put onto Naked Wines by a friend and i must say from the first bottle of wine it has been a tremendous experience of wine which I am glad I undertook. From the ordering service, through delivery of the wine package, its first class. i can honestly say I have never been disappointed at any of the bottles of wine that have been supplied, all with their own unique taste. Superb.
NakedWines	GB	It is a reliable and honest company	16 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	It is a very reliable company  to deal with. There is a great selection of wines to choose from and  from the 1st moment you became an Angel and  start choosing wines they start to recommend  ones that suit your taste I have been purchasing  wines from Naked Wines for a few years, and never been disappointed. Once you have become  a Nsked Angel if you order 12 bottles in one shipment they give you a free one, and  if it's not to your taste they over a different one. They are usually a more expensive  wine than I normally buy but it's nice as pressies.Its a subscription  service in a sense as you pay a monthly amount which you can use to purchase wine each month or you could save up and buy for an event say for instance a wedding or Christmas  or you could choose for Presents. Since I have been on naked wines I have only had 2 bottles I didnt like. Once you receive  your order write a review as it helps others to choose also if it wasnt to your liking  the advisors will recommend others to try.

NakedWines	GB	An excellent selection at splendid prices	16 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I have been an Angel in Naked Wines for some years now.  Took a little while to get there but it has been certainly worth it.  The range and quality of all the wines I have bought has been outstanding.  Naked  Wines note what you buy and  comments on your potential  to like or dislike any new wine based on your past purchases.   The suppliers, from vineyards all over the world, are generally smaller producers and most wines are not available in stores.  Delivery is well organised and usually very prompt.   I have never been disappointed.

The quality of the wines is excellent, good value for money and most importantly the ability to read reviews and discuss wines with other Angels really helps me select wines I know will be to my taste. Only issues I've ever had have been re deliveries but Naked have always provided excellent customer service and put things right straight away.
NakedWines	GB	I have never had a bad bottle of wine…	16 June 2021	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	I have never had a bad bottle of wine from Naked Wines.  The delivery is always on time.   My only complaint is a lot of the wines are 14 to 14.5%. I prefer my wine to be 13 to 13.5%.  But I suppose that is a question of taste.  I cannot complain about the service.
NakedWines	GB	So many new wine styles to try.	16 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Started buying wines through Naked Wines at the beginning of lock down and am still doing it. The staff are brilliant if you ever need to contact them, and the selection of wine has been great. I've tried so many different grape types rather than sticking with Sauvignon Blanc all the time. Their app is really useful so you can review the wines and rate them for the next time you place an order.

Reasonably priced, once tried you'll never buy again from supermarkets.

There has not been one wine we have not enjoyed and it is so interesting to see the personal low down on the winemakers.  When I received a bottle of wine I hadn’t ordered the company were very quick to sort it out. I would highly recommend them.
NakedWines	GB	The wines I receive from Naked Wine are phenomenal not had a bad one yet	16 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	The wines I receive from Naked Wine are out of this world. What is really nice is that you pay so much per month into your account and when you come to order your wine it is almost paid for, therefore, it’s far less painful!!!!  The wines are truly fantastic from these smaller vineyards and seem to have far more depth and taste than wines from a much larger concern. I will forever thank my neighbour who told me about Naked Wines.
NakedWines	GB	A wide range of excellent wine	16 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	A wide range of excellent wine, not your run of the mill supermarket produce. Easy to use website and reliable service.  A lock down saviour! Highly recommend.

NakedWines	GB	I love Naked Wines	16 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I love Naked Wines, I’ve used them for a few years now and having my own little “wine savings account” as an angel has been great. They always have fab offers and I’ve never had a bad bottle of wine from them. Also the customer service has been spot on if I’ve ever had to contact them. Would definitely recommend to anyone who likes to kick back with a glass of wine!
NakedWines	GB	Great company	16 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Great company.  Helps you try different wines and at a competitive price.
NakedWines	GB	Why you should use Naked Wines	16 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I have been using Naked Wines for just over a year now and find their service excellent. By providing wines selected to my tastes at exceptional value and quality alongside rewarding loyalty with regular free bottles I cannot fault the customer experience. The whole ethos of the company in supporting small independent winemakers is laudable and something I am very pleased to be part of. With no pressure to buy or heavy-handed marketing techniques this is a business with the interests of both suppliers and customers fundamental to their operation. I can recommend this company wholeheartedly.
NakedWines	GB	Excellent wines	16 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Excellent wines, well priced and delivered with care on time.

NakedWines	GB	Great wine	16 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Wine is delivered on time un excellent condition by in my case at least considerate drivers. If wine can  be delivered early it is, a time is given when to expect it. All wines are good some are very good and these I order again. Cannot fault Naked wines.
NakedWines	GB	Caters for every taste and budget while supporting producers of astoundingly good and unique wine!	16 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	We joined Naked Wines via a friend who gave us a voucher for a discount on our first order. We were impressed by the mission and personalised approach. So, I think we're 18 months in now and it keeps getting better. My partner follows a vegan diet, and we realised that we could design amazing cases if we used the vegan search filter on the website. At one point we decided that our big vegan cases would be made up using lower and moderately priced bottles, while we use our Wine Genie subscription to keep a stock of more expensive wines. That way, we get table wine, occasion wine and super fancy wine, guaranteed to be delivered to our door quickly, and regularly. I like following the wine producers on the site, and feel excited to be contributing to independent wine production around the world. The best thing though is obviously the moment when you open a bottle...
NakedWines	GB	Great Wines. Great Price	16 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Always get a good selection of wines for a good price. Struggled a bit last year but was expected as a lot of businesses did. Now receiving the wines I order and fantastic. You don't have to commit to monthly orders just order when you want. Your direct debit of whatever you want to put into your account  goes towards helping winemakers all over the world.

There is always a good variety to choose from and I tend to  trust the rating that other people have given and I've not been disappointed. I'm not a wine expert, but I think the wines are generally good value and I like the fact that delivery can be free depending on quantity ordered. The order process is very simple and enjoyable. The delivery date is given and can be tracked and so you know exactly when its coming. The 'freebies' are good too!

I was charged for the full order and had to email the company to get my refund. It was rather unfortunate and inconvenient. To be fair, the company refunded my money and compensated me £15 for the inconvenience. I will give Naked Wine the benefit of the doubt and give them another chance.

NakedWines	GB	Enjoyable Experience	16 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I feel that being a Naked Wines 'Angel' is like being part of big family. I enjoy getting the chatty emails (they're not too frequent) and hearing about the different charities they support and raise money for.I also like the variety of wine on offer, and occasional gifts of a bottle of wine popped into my basket to try. It's easy to have a standing order set up and then treat myself to one of the mixed cases once I have enough money in my account. This enables me to try lots of different handpicked varieties of wine that I wouldn't normally try, so it's like having a nice treat every so often.I like the concept - and the wine!

NakedWines	GB	Naked wines for the win	16 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	"Love the opportunity to try wines outside my comfort zone, get access to new wines and tailor my experience to suit myself. The subscription service means I've always got ""money in the bank"" and it's proven useful for large celebrations or Christmas where I can order boxes of wines for gifts or parties using that banked money, reducing the impact on my bank balance at otherwise expensive times of the year. Overall I love it and would highly recommend to anyone."

NakedWines	GB	A first class act	16 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Since joining NW I have had the pleasure of drinking wines that I like without the hit or miss selection process in the supermarkets. NW provides an excellent description of all their wines and suggests wines I haven't tried, that I might like,  based on my past preferences.I now get all my wines from NW because I know I'm going to enjoy every drop.Cases I've received in the past from other wine companies have always contained some bottles that I didn't like and some I poured straight down the sink.Now with NW I order exactly what I want and have absolutely no wastage.From my observations to date NW selects excellent wines, to satisfy the most discerning of customers and at very reasonable prices. Thank you Naked Wines.Praise where praise is due. 🍾🥂
NakedWines	GB	Keeping sane during covid	16 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	When Covid first started I was shielding and yes I could drink alcohol.  A young girl was doing my shopping and wasn’t about to ask her to buy wine.  A friend recommended Naked wines and I have not been disappointed at all.  If something does go wrong which is rare, Naked Wines go out of their way to put it right and you will often find a free bottle of wine has been added to your case.  They are a sheer delight to talk to and joined some of their sessions when they were talking to the wine growers which was very interesting.  I have no hesitation of recommending them to my friends.

NakedWines	GB	A fine way to buy nice wine	16 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Since joining Naked Wines in November 2020 I've had a very positive experience. A very good selection of wines from around the world at fair prices. Delivery has always been timely and a single slight glitch (with a wrong bottle being delivered once) was handled professionally by way of a refund. The £20.00 monthly fee is not a subscription but goes straight into your wine-buying account, so its not a problem for me. There's also a bonus free bottle on offer every month, which is another plus.
NakedWines	GB	Consistently excellent wines	16 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Consistently excellent wines, great value, lots of variety, excellent customer service.

Enjoyed drinking wines I wouldn’t normally have the opportunity to buy from the supermarket. The value and quality are excellent. The Angel ratings are extremely helpful to a layman like me and as improved the range outside the the more popular bottles I used to stick to. The Christmas case is a must
NakedWines	GB	Excellent service	16 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Excellent service, not had a bad bottle yet! Love the Xmas specials.
NakedWines	GB	Wonderful wine and Sevice	16 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Wonderful wine and Sevice. It’s also very cool that you know who you are supporting with your purchase and brings a story to your glass. Been with them for a few years now and proud to be part of that story too.
NakedWines	GB	They have some brilliant winemakers	16 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	
NakedWines	GB	Good Wine, Good Community, Good Service	16 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I have been buying wine from Naked for 10 years. I have enjoyed the variety they offer and I have never had a bad wine - some I like much more than others - but no bad experiences. I also enjoy the communal atmosphere and being able to be in direct contact with the individual wine makers. I commend the way the company have supported wine makers in trouble over the Covid period or for other reasons. The way the Angels have supported Carmen Stephens and the poor children in S Africa is heartening. Service has suffered a bit during Covid but I have never had a serious problem and whenever I have had an issue it has been dealt with quickly, fairly and very pleasantly. Highly Recommend!!!
NakedWines	GB	Brilliant wines	16 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Brilliant wines, not had a bad one yet, great service alongside free taster wine (full bottle) with most deliveries, very reasonably priced for the quality you get, all in all superb Company

I am now converted and as of yet after around 8 to 9 cases of wine being delivered. I am yet to report on a bad wine . Keep on the great work. My favourites are the Arabella reds .
NakedWines	GB	Excellent service, and stunning wine	16 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I love supporting independent vineyards, by enjoying a huge range of wine.The customer service is second to none - always professional, informative and helpful.I like that I can rate wine, and see how I have rated past wines so that I don't need remember. I also appreciate that Naked Wines use these ratings to suggest new wines for me to try.I have been a very happy Naked Wines member for a number of years, but especially during the national Lockdown!
NakedWines	GB	Excellent source of nice wines	16 June 2021	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	Excellent source of nice wines at not unreasonable prices. Quick delivery which can be free if order of sufficient value. If you become a Naked Wines Angel by paying a set amount per month this helps lower prices. This set amount goes into your account, and if you stop the subscription, any balance is returned to you. Often a free bonus bottle available.
NakedWines	GB	Wonderful Naked Wines	16 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I have been a customer for the last 19 months. The wines are wonderful and by being a member you really do make a difference to small wineries. Where else could you get to know the wine makers by name on zoom calls! Excellent customer services, who should a bottle not to be to your taste, will provide a refund. You set the amount you want to put into your account each month, there is also a free bottle each month if you order a case (very easy to do and no pressure at all).
NakedWines	GB	A Wine firm very well worth trying	16 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	"I find the ""Naked Wines"" (silly name notwithstanding) excellent value for money;the ""Arabella"" range in particular, though there are some others that are good. I have given three of my neighbours Naked's  coupons offering a large discount on one's introductory case, together with a sample bottle, and I know that one has already become ""an Angel"", signed up for the modest monthly direct debit, which gives a customer a useful reduction on prices. ""Naked"" is now my main source of wine."
NakedWines	GB	Brilliant and efficient company .	16 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Brilliant and efficient company , superb wines.
NakedWines	GB	Nine years a satisfied customer	16 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Having bought all our wine from Naked for the past nine years, it is not surprising that we like the wine they sell, we think it is good value, and we find them an excellent company with which to do business.
NakedWines	GB	Great wines	16 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Great wines. Good value for regulars (angels). And you are helping small winemakers to stay in business.
NakedWines	GB	Good quality wine at a fair price	16 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	We have been buying wine from Naked Wines for over a year now and have always been very happy with the quality and price of the wine.  They are not pushy like some other wine companies.

It may seem an expensive way to buy wines, but it really isn't as the average price is no more than those at the supermarket.
NakedWines	GB	My favourite way to shop for wine.	16 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Great selection of wines from unique growers, delivered safely and on time. Having been an angel for coming up for 2 years now we’ve already developed a core set of ‘go to’ favourites along with trying something new each time around.The extra offers are great and becoming an Angel was really simple. The monthly savings plan gives you a lovely pot to spend if you can leave it to grow for a couple of months or so. We save the equivalent cost of a couple of decent bottles of your favourite high street wine a month and it’s worth the sacrifice!Very happy to stay an Angel for the foreseeable future.

NakedWines	GB	A recent convert	16 June 2021	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	I like the Angel concept where your chosen monthly prepayment unlocks better prices and goes towards Naked’s investment in developing and supporting small producers. Naked’s range assortment and prices tend towards the premium, you will definitely get cheaper entry level and mainstream wines at your local supermarket, but there are some gems to be found at all price points when you explore the variety on offer. They do sell out of the best value wines, so be quick completing your order if you find yourself hooked on a particular bottle! The monthly freebie is always interesting and could tempt you into higher strata (which obviously is what it’s designed to do!).Although it’s an overused phrase, I do get a sense of community from the online interaction, and several friends have also joined up so it’s interesting to compare notes. Overall I would recommend giving them a try.
NakedWines	GB	Great choice of wines	16 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I have been with Naked Wines for several years now. Always an exceptional choice of wines at a competitive price. Service has consistently been excellent.I am happy to recommend their selection and serviceMike Mears

NakedWines	GB	Great wines, fast delivery	16 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	"Great wines, very fast delivery, good value.I have a small subscription (£20/month) so I end up having to top-up my balance whenever I order a case of wine, but I like the feeling of getting the case for ""just the top-up cost"" as I've already taken the pain of the subscription. I'm lying to myself, I know, but it all helps. And the wines are nice too."

When the occasional issue arises, naked are prompt and help to resolve things.And a final bonus is the funds that are released to help those in need. What’s not to like?

Extremely efficient polite and when required, responsive to meet any concerns. Holding Zoom calls with various wine-makers and sharing regular blogs/blogs, allowing us the customer, to vote for inclusion or not if wines, for respective awards also help the “buy in” to the cause, call it clever marketing or not, it works for me, and must mention the work that they help facilitate with schoolchildren in South Africa is also highly commendable and a breath of fresh air in this often all too cynical World. Yes, I’m hooked and happy to be!

I had never been a member of a wine club before but I have learned so much by reading all the information on the website and watching the winemaker videos. I now now have a better understanding of the kind of wines I like and enjoy saving each month towards my next order. I like to review each wine I buy because this helps when choosing my next bottles. I have only had one bottle which I really didn’t like. I sent a message to Naked Wine and was immediately refunded the money for the bottle.  Being a member of Naked Wine has turned into an enjoyable hobby.

They are a company who cares about customer service, and will always take the time to solve any issues.Delivery is always on time and prices are keen with Angel discounts, with a good variety of wines. Plus I like that I can contribute to start ups and not just line the pockets of the big boys.

It’s great to belong to a co-operative that supports small business by enjoying great wines. We’ve always been very pleased with the quality and service

NakedWines	AU	Superb	15 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	"I've been an ""Angel"" for a couple of years now, I really am a very happy member. I really like the idea of being able to support wine growers and have communication with them about their creations. I have discovered some absolute gems and in all honesty, I have had maybe two bottles which I didn't particularly enjoy - Nothing wrong with them, just not to my tastes. One instance I had a few wines substituted, without realising, and when I spoke to Naked about it, they just refunded the two bottles I had tried to buy, without any drama at all.Deliveries almost always arrive on time, even during the height of COVID lockdowns and I've never had anything damaged, not even the box.If you like wine, if you like being part of a community that asks nothing of you and if you want to get access to some delights you will not find on a supermarket shelf - I really do recommend you try Naked Wines :)"
NakedWines	GB	Great way to buy and to support small winemakers	15 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	A good company and great way to buy. I am not a wine connoisseur so tend to stick to their cases or recommendations. I have enjoyed the vast majority of wines from Naked and it’s nice to try different things. There are regular deals for members which makes buying good quality wine more affordable and the monthly payment is a great idea - takes the sting out of restocking!  I like the idea that you are supporting small wine makers too. Ordering is easy and delivery very quick.
NakedWines	GB	Naked Wines. Outstanding quality and fairly priced.	15 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	We order our wine from Naked Wines often. Extensive selection. Outstanding quality! Wines you can get nowhere else.
NakedWines	GB	A wine company with a difference.	15 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I have been a an 'Angel' member for years. I pay £20 a month into my account and save up to choose a pre-set case. Beautiful wines with excellent discount for an 'Angel' price. Then I top up on my favourites as needed. It is great to meet the winemakers that you are supporting in the Naked Wine tasting events - or online in COVID years!- so you know where your money is going. I have never had a disappointing wine and I cannot recommend them enough. The freebies are always welcome and the Christmas case is a highlight.

We liked Naked Wines ethos, and also that you can be flexible about the amount you put into your account, furthermore that you could cancel at any time and get any monies in your account refunded. They also had a great offer on an introductory case of wine.The wines have been fantastic, I love that when you rate the wines it means that they can suggest other wines that you would like, or even tell you wines that you wouldn't like. We have really been able to tell the difference in quality compared to what we used to buy (mid range bottles from the supermarket), they are much better. We even tried another wine subscription, thinking that they would all be as good.... this was not the case, we came straight back to Naked Wines. I would highly recommend, 5 stars everytime.

I selected a white wine that was new and had only at that stage a few reviews, and not normally being a white wine drinker I thought I would give it a try. It was the finest white wine I had ever tried, so I gave it a rave review. A week later I went to order a couple of cases only to get a mail from the staff saying sorry, after your review we sold out in days, Thanks. There is a lesson in there somewhere, like don't be afraid to try something new. If it's from naked wine it will definitely surprise you. Also if you do have any problems the team will sort it.

If your the type of person, like myself, who loves to taste new wines and enjoy the unique attributes each wine has you wont be disappointed.I have always said it impossible for one person to claim a wine is good or bad as it is always a matter of taste, but after 2 years and having received many wine selection packages i dont think i can recall one wine that didnt go down very well. The personal method of communication is also a very pleasant experience, i get the impression someone is actually on the other end who really loves their wine too!!!!

In that time I have only had 2 bottles of wine that were not up my expectations (though those at times were slightly misguided!). On one occasion when the bottle was 'off' I posted the fact and was almost immediately berated by the producer in Australia despite the fact I suggested a faulty cork rather than the wine could have been to blame. That abuse was not Naked's fault but I was not aware they stepped in to warn off the producer. I hope now they would do so.The Naked customer service is generally of high quality.The wines seem to have become more expensive over the years, though that is a very subjective issue!Naked are also to be congratulated for their effort in supporting a charity providing food for needy kids in South Africa.

NakedWines	GB	Hi I joined naked wines not realising…honest to good wines	15 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Hi I joined naked wines not realising if I really liked  wine , however every order I have had gets me excited, I am so into my red wine now,  from about 7 orders now , I think I’ve only had 2/3 wines that weren’t nice , ( to my pallet) didn’t stop me drinking them , it’s amazing the difference in some wines if they’re left to breathe , or decanted. All these things I picked up by being in the angels site /app . I still buy occasional super market wines , I think you can get some at a better price and just as nice , if you know what grape or region they come from , not that I mind paying naked prices , the quality is really good , and for a great cause ! Easily for me to recommend naked wines I have done so many times . Delivery is fantastic, only ever had 1 time issue were there was a spillage at depot , when the issue was raised with naked , it was resolved brilliantly without any hassle, money refunded within 24 hours and free bottle for my trouble. Loving the whole experience, thanks naked wines . X

NakedWines	GB	Great affordable wine	15 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I have been buying wine from Naked for several years, and have enjoyed them, almost without exception. The purchase process is easy, and boxes are delivered to the door exactly as promised. Wines are sourced from every part of the globe, and a regular buckshee bottle dropped into your case is very welcome! Updates via Email from growers on how their crop is doing add to the experience, and it feels good to know that drinking their wine helps growers start-up and develop a business. Highly recommend.
NakedWines	GB	A very happy Naked Angel	15 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I joined Naked wines 2 years ago and have nothing but praise for them. I love the fact that you can message your favourite wine growers and get to know their story, what they are up to at the present time and hear Re the crops etc. The customer service at Naked have always been so helpful and respond quickly. The delivery service is great and they let you know when your wine is ready for delivery. I especially love the “Thirsty Tuesday” when Naked have zoom meetings with wine growers and you can log into zoom and listen and enjoy a glass with them. Apart from all this the wine selection is great, what more could you want. Thanks Naked Wines.

Becoming an Angel gives you discounted prices and occasional free offers to tempt you to place an order. Only let down once when a delivery promised for before Easter arrived after.

NakedWines	GB	Great company	15 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Been buying my wine from naked now since November 2020 and in that time I have tried around 50 different wines and only found about 4 that I was not too keen on so not bad going.I did try a couple of reds but I’m not a red wine drinker so wasn’t keen but members of my family liked them, so I stick to white wine.Only had one issue with naked and that was that they sent me 6 bottles that I did not order as a replacement without informing me, but once I contacted them they gave me a refund of half the cost of the 6 bottles or the option to send them back.Overall I am very pleased with naked and the service and enjoying tasting all the different wines.

NakedWines	GB	I joined Naked Wines over a year ago	15 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I joined Naked Wines over a year ago. I had been in other wine clubs previously and they do not compare to Naked Wines. You feel you are part of something and not just a customer. Naked Wines don't put pressure to buy every month, they let me save my payment for when I need it, this is good.The range of wine not in the supermarket is great and serious quality.  Additionally they keep me posted with deals and throw in the odd free bottle which is great. I have now recommended Naked Wines to three other people and they love it.
NakedWines	GB	Naked Wines	15 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Naked Wines offers high quality products, excellent customer service and a very quick delivery. I particularly like the business model that means I am not only purchasing wine but providing investment to small, independent producers. I have enjoyed trying a wide range of unusual and interesting wines. The online sessions give an insight into the producers and the wines. It is an imaginative business model and is being delivered in a highly professional manner.

NakedWines	GB	Naked wines	15 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I’ve been a naked angel for about 3 years now, I previously bought all my wine through the Tesco wine club. I used to buy known brands from Tesco, thinking all wines would be very similar, how wrong I was once I’d tried naked wines. I don’t profess to know much about red wine, which I drink, my wife white, but you can taste the difference in quality in the wines which we now drink.As for naked, they have a huge choice, you get free samples, and they always deliver on time. I cannot see me leaving the naked angels anytime soon, and can highly recommend them.

I used to buy all our wine from supermarkets and sometimes a wine shop. Always paid around £12 per bottle and at Christmas would splash out around £25 for a few celebratory bottles. Occasionally this would misfire and we would have a couple of iffy bottles. This has never happened with Naked wines. All the wine is excellent for the price and I can buy a greater range of smaller estate wines that just can’t be beat. The reviews from others helps me choose and my own ratings guide me to other wines too. Throw in some freebie gift bottles and it’s a winning combination.

You can connect directly with the winemakers who respond appropriately even if their wine is not to your taste. The online events are fantastic as you can taste wines, learn about what the winegrowers are doing and see where they are doing it which is amazing when we cannot travel anywhere! If you're at all interested, give it a try. I'm not drinking currently but am still saving each month so that come Christmas time I can buy one of their offers. The flexibility is great, I am learning about wine and wish I had done it sooner.

Their wines are fantastic, the events (when they can happen) are a highlight, the customer service is superb, and their delivery/packaging is great. Dealing with them is always an absolute pleasure, nothing is too much trouble. But most importantly really, they supply the best wines I’ve found! Have found so many winemakers that I will be buying for the rest of my life, and all at prices that beat most decent wines in the supermarket! I can’t imagine I’ll ever move to getting wine from anywhere else.

The wine is excellent, fair price and delivered in a timely well packaged fashion. I love the ethos of the Company and will be a customer for a long time.
NakedWines	GB	Disruptive	15 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I have to admit to not being convinced of yet another wine website/merchant when first told.  SInce I have been a member, it has been a revelation.  I regularly order wines and don't even bother to wait until my monthly payments are sufficient to pay for my total order.  The wines are invariably good and I have not yet had a less than passable one.  Some of them are truly extraordinary.  I particularly like receiving a response from the winemaker when I make comments about a specific wine.  I can recommend Naked Wine to anybody wishing to try a reliable but different approach to their drinking needs.  Surely, this means everybody.

NakedWines	GB	WARNING: SCAM TO DEDUCT MONEY BY MAKING YOU AN 'ANGEL'	15 June 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	WARNING - A SCAM! Got a voucher, which said no club joining or monthly fees.  They've sneakily worded it so that after paying for your first case, they make you an 'angel' which entitles them to deduct £20 a month from your account!  Lying b*stards. Just be honest with people.  I might have bought your wine if you had been.

NakedWines	GB	Great to have direct contact with winemakers	15 June 2021	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	In general my experience with Naked Wines has been good - I like the fact that contact with the oenologists is not only possible, but two-way. Some of the wines selected are a bit predictable but usually of far better quality than standard supermarket fare. Not keen on having substitute wines sent when the chosen wine is out of stock, but I'm nit-picking.

I've made a number of attempts to contact Naked Wines about my upcoming delivery but so far have had no reply. Their chat bot is terrible & my most recent order which was due to arrive at the start of June is still not here. I can't fault the wines but I think this will be my last orderJust to add an update. I did receive a request for more information from Trust Pilot l, which I supplied, however I have had no further contact from Naked Wines so I have cancelled my order & subscription.q

NakedWines	GB	Highly recommended Wine Company	14 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I highly recommend this company. I like the fact that you are not committed to buying wine every month as with many companies. There is a big selection of mixed cases and you can re order any from the cases that you really like. If there are any problems their customer service is very helpful and you are given constant updates when you are expecting a delivery. You are quite often offered a free bottle too with your order. The other advantage is that you are helping small independent wine makers to get their product on the market. Now I wouldn’t buy from anywhere else but Naked Wines and have recommended them to other people. Please keep up the good work. Thank you x

NakedWines	GB	My introduction to Naked Wines	14 June 2021	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	I was introduced to Naked Wines via a birthday present from my sister.  I was so impressed by the selection of wines that I became a subscriber. I have never regretted it for a moment and now look forward to each consignment with keen anticipation. This has become a very pleasant learning experience as I learn more about the production of some very good wines from dedicated and enthusiastic producers.  Every wine I have received from Naked Wines has been a revelation and a joy to taste.I now understand why Omar Kayyam said “ I often wonder what the vintners buy one half so valuable as the goods they sell”
NakedWines	GB	Great wines, great customer service, great community.	14 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I’ve been a Naked Wines “Angel” for about 7 months now and I absolutely love it. I can’t profess to being a wine buff but the website is so good at sniffing out the wines that you’re most likely to like based on your preferences and how well you rate the wine. The more you rate, the better NW is at figuring out how much you’re going to like the wine. I also like how engaged the wine makers are with the Angels, it’s really a community. It has been nice to be involved in some of the charitable/supportive endeavours that NW promoting within the wine community. Anytime I’ve had a slight issue - wrong wine in box, not liking a wine - customer service have been excellent at making it right.Occasionally it’s a bit annoying when you can’t get hold of a wine you really enjoyed and it would be nice to have some more countries involved where perhaps the wines are more niche but really excellent (Greece, Slovenia, Slovakia!) but I gather this is because NW invests in their makers and so carries multiple wines from them instead of casting the net wide.With all that said, the quality of the wine (regardless of your budget!) is really excellent and heads and shoulders above what you can get for the same price in the supermarket.

They even offer you your money back if you don't like a wine.It's a company you can trust to do the right and best thing with your money.

NakedWines	GB	I love being part of Naked Wines	14 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I love being part of Naked Wines. You choose to pay a certain amount each month, but they don't push you to buy each month. Your money accumulates and when you order a case, they deduct your accumulated amount. It is so easy to choose the wines, clear and unbiased reviews for each one! And always a freebie with your case. With your money, they invest in small wine growers' businesses.  I like the idea of what your buying is unique, and helps small companies to become viable.And most of the wines we've had so far are good to very good, and sometimes excellent. Highly recommended!!

NakedWines	GB	Don’t hesitate, become an Angel 😇 today	14 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	We joined Naked wines over a year ago and have been really pleased with all the wines that we have had. We ordered an initial case on an offer and if you go in and review each wine like they ask you to it builds a profile so that wines are recommended when you buy again. We pay £30 a month and then buy a case of different wines once our money builds up a bit that way you are not paying it all at once.Also the added bonus is they always give you a free bottle with each 12 bottles you buy which is automatically added to your basket.Would definitely recommend trying as it feels good to drink the wine when you have helped companies who are on need with your subscription.Every penny to pay to them goes into your account to spend.Give them a go today and become an Angel like us.you won’t regret it!!

NakedWines	GB	Naked Angels are winners	14 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Last year I received a voucher for £75 off a case of wine and it promised to refund me for any wines I didn't like. Well I thought it was worth a punt since none of the supermarkets do that.I have used Naked Wines for just over a year now and during that time I have only found one wine I didn't like and of course I was offered a refund.Just before lockdown my wife passed away and so I was grieving and wasn't sure of what I wanted to do. When I learned of the help that Naked Wines has given to winemakers around the world during this past dreadful year I realised that I could drink fantastic wines at a discounted price and help people at the same time. I became an angel and put £20 per month into the pot, which is used to provide a helping hand for the winemakers and pays for my wine in advance. Naked Wines also has a charity that has recently raised over three quarters of a million pounds to help feed children in South Africa aiding Carmen Stevens (Google her) winemaker and wonderful person.Being an Angel with Naked Wines means getting great wines, Gin, whisky and cider and getting a warm glow for doing something good whilst enjoying the benefits.

The relationship the Company has with its producers is amazing, supporting the growers to offer affordable and delicious wines for the benefit of the Angels. It also feels very personal, with the producers updating the angels on their wines. Of course the most important thing is that the wine is delicious!Great wine, genuinely friendly service and good value for money with the added benefit of an organisation actively supporting small producers, well worth considering if you want to know where your wine is coming from

NakedWines	GB	A great way to support and taste small producers	14 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I have been  with Naked wines for around a year. Wine choice is great and enables smaller growers to access the market. Never been disappointed and have made some great discoveries. The monthly payment model works very well.
NakedWines	GB	I took advantage of one of those offers…	14 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I took advantage of one of those offers that Naked Wines recently put out on Twitter.Although I am one of many Angels in UK and globally, i do feel like a valued customer where they actually answer the phone, listen to the problems and provide solutions in respect of deliveries or questions about wine and grapes.You pay money in to your fund each month starting at £20 a month & that is your money going towards paying for a box of 12 bottles where you can top up the fund which pays for the box or you wait until your fund tops out & then spend it.This is your money after all, which is invested in small and independent wine growers offering you better quality of wine, where you feel you are helping those who need the investment and not supermarkets or middle-men. You can remove your money at anytime & close your account if not satisfied with the service. There are sample bottles to add to your choice of 12 which is a bonus.My way of doing my membership will be to order 2 lots per year - I ordered the white without Sauvignon about a month ago (without because it's horrible) and I have not been disappointed with any of the bottles - they are superb.In addition you can help other Angels by reviewing the wines - be honest because the wine growers read them as well and they need to know what is popular and what isn't.
NakedWines	GB	Great company to do business with!	14 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I am delighted with both the wines and the quality of service from Naked Wines, and was very happy they started Zoom calls during the pandemic.

NakedWines	GB	Naked Wines - an accidental discovery	14 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I started ordering from Naked Wines after I took in a parcel for a neighbour - I'd never heard of them before!  Since then I guess we have bought 2/3 of the wine we drink from Naked. The upsides are that we enjoy rather better wine than before and we get the warm feeling that we are helping wine producers via our Angel account. The down side is that we have realised that we appreciate wines at a slightly higher price point than before!

Whatever you invest it’s yours to spend, there’s no catch.The fund raising work that Naked Wine does is commendable. You feel you are making a difference , with minimal guestures.  I’m not really a wine buff or a real wine drinker but the wines you order are just so good, high quality and some are absolutely stunning.  My friends always comment when we have a night at home.The social networking sessions are very informative, and you don’t have to take part, just sit back and listen as they are very informative.  I have enjoyed my first year with Naked Wine and also becoming an Angel.Alex
NakedWines	GB	Lovely wine from smaller producers	14 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Lovely wine from smaller producers, not the mass produced wine sold through supermarkets.

NakedWines	GB	Why I support Naked Wines	14 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I’ve been a supporter of Naked Wines for a few years now. I like the fact that I can decide how I use it; I pay a monthly subscription which I “save up” to treat myself to a case of wine every few months. I can also salve my conscience, knowing that I’m also supporting developing and struggling wine-makers (so I’m helping others as well as myself). And the wine is high quality, at not-quite-so-high prices. Sorry if this sounds like a Naked Wines add - it just reflects my experience.

NakedWines	GB	We love Naked Wines. Excellent value for money	14 June 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I have been using Naked Wines for a few years now and have not had a wine that I wouldn't buy again. Unfortunately the best wines go very quickly, and a lot of them are the best! I really like the fact you can subscribe and then when you come to buy some wine, it is almost already paid for. The Christmas box is very good value for money.

NakedWines	GB	Very mediocre wines. Too young	12 June 2021	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	Very mediocre wines and not that well priced. As everyone has said, they claim they’re not a wine club but that bending the truth to put it mildly. I would say 80% of the wines I’ve had are poor value when compared to a much more transparent online service such as The Wine Society who are not only cheaper, but their wines are better and released when ready to drink. One thing Naked do is release wine that is far too young and not really in the drinking window.

The app and website are super user friendly, if you need to speak to them they are a joy as well as being quick and efficient. And the wine is delicious and reasonably pricedI’m taking an extended break from drinking alcohol so I reluctantly cancelled my subscription- again this was easy and quick and they automatically returned any money sat I my account.Bravo to Naked Wines - just brilliant.

NakedWines	GB	Bad customer service…	10 June 2021	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	missing box was reordered after days of emailing and ringing both Naked Wine & Yodel. I was told that the new delivery would be VIP and I would not have to pay for it (pay for what the delivery that I didn't receive) Then both boxes were delivered which I had to go and collect and were very heavy. I contacted Naked wine to let them know I had 2 boxes and I was asked if I would like to keep the second box with £20 off. With all the trouble I have had making calls and chasing I would have thought at least out of courteous I would have been allowed to keep the box:( Not happy) Forgot to mention that I have been asked to leave the box outside my house as I work, so just letting any burglars know that my house is empty. ALL SORTED NOW WITH A VERY HAPPY OUTCOME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH 👍

NakedWines	US	Failed Delivery with No Customer Service	05 June 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Did not receive the Wines.Delivery company was YodelChain of EventsDay 1: Yodel say they cannot find the AddressDay 2: I update instructions to find the address. Yodel say they deliver it. I am in the property, do not receive the card. It is not in my safe place nor with my neighbours. Ask Yodel where it is and they say they will get back to meDay 3: Yodel update status to Damaged - Contact SellerNo, so far you may say this is a review of Yodel, but the issue is that I have been unable to contact a human being at either Yodel OR NAKED WINES to resolve this. I have sadly come to the conclusion that I am now out of pocket to the tune of £58 as the automated systems of either Yodel or Naked Wines dont cover this eventuality. I do feel that Yodel have made the mistake and passed the buck, but if I cant actually speak to anybody to solve this then all I can say is that Naked Wines have set up a system where they dont have to take responsibility for actually getting their product to the customer.
NakedWines	GB	Unwanted subscription service	04 June 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Purchased 6 bottles of wine then automatically entered into a monthly subscription service which I did not want to join.

NakedWines	GB	Shady tactics at best	01 June 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Shady tactics which seems to sign you up unwittingly to a monthly subscription/investment/club membership. There is no doubt they know this as there are many comments on Trust Pilot relating to the same gripe. In fact it doesn’t matter how transparent Naked Wines think they are, the bottom line is it appears to happen a lot. Coincidently, this also happened to a friend of mine recently when I happened to mention this in passing.Yes you can cancel, yes you can get a refund (I haven’t received one yet) but this set up is not what I would call best practice.Far more transparency is key, regardless whether Naked Wines claim they send numerous emails prior to monies being taken (Naked Wines emails went to my spam folder, which in my opinion seemed like the filters on my email software were doing their job properly).My glass was half empty in this instance.

I had no idea.  I could never afford to do that, I am a pensioner.  If there is a catch like this it should be noted when you sign up, not by word of mouth on a review siteI am sure the wine will be great - but I can't afford £25 a month ""just in case"" for the next lot - sorry.  My review is therefore not about the wine (yet) it's about getting caught (which I was until I opted out) for a continuing payment I cannot affordNAKED - please make this clear for everyone and allow opt out rather than automatic opt in"

NakedWines	GB	Started off well then downhill	26 May 2021	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	I have been a customer for 4 years and have had a few little hiccups but by and by good service. However... wanted guidance on some wines for a couple of special occassions and sought help in choosing. Took a few days to do this with waiting for responses but eventually all sorted and my request for it to be delivered to my sons as it was for his 40th celebrations were confirmed. Litterally on the same day we were advised of the date/time for delivery, we requested a different slot as my son had a prior engagment and confirmation was received that this had been changed. Downhill from here as I had a text on the original date that it was on it's way... my son was delayed almost 4 hours in travelling to a function due to this and it held up events, unfortunately no where to leave the wine safely so he had no choice. I was not at all happy with Naked and the reasons for this error, they just said oh sorry it was dispatched no idea how as it was changed, here have £10 on your account.... it wasn't me that dealt with it, no concerns that my son had held a function up due to their inadequacies just take £10 and go away... on checking my account I am not sure they have also used funds from my account but will check this out with them in person, looks like they took the new £30 I had uped it too but not the £40 in the old address details, but hey no doubt they'll get to it shortly. I actually feel service has dropped after Eamon leaving but will see how it goes over my next order.

NakedWines	GB	Frustrating and a teensy bit insulting	23 May 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I came to the Naked Wines website on the back of receiving a £75 promotional voucher from another company. I was really put off by the tiring quiz, then getting locked on a screen offering a £30 voucher I didn’t want, but figured I’d give it another go and rebooted and skipped the quiz etc. Then I started trying to assemble a case of the wines I like and of less familiar ones only to find that most of the wines that I was interested in turned out to be restricted to so-called ‘Angels’, which would mean me joining a club, when I’d have to pay a subscription, it would not be clear if I could use my original voucher etc. etc. The whole experience was just too frustrating and actually a bit insulting - you spot a wine you like then discover that you are a second class customer and can’t buy it. It’s like going into a shop that won’t sell you most of what they have on their shelves. So I’m giving up and my £75 voucher is in the recycling.Response to KarlThanks, Karl, for your replies and offer, but I won’t be taking it up, and you do not seem to acknowledge the root of the problem. You downplay the ‘Angel-exclusive’ wines, but the truth is very different. The results of four of my searches on your site were as follows: Sauvignon blanc – 14 wines listed, 3 available to non-Angels; Chardonnay – 12 wines listed, none available to non-Angels; Pouilly fume – 3 listed, none available; Merlot – 13 listed, 2 available. This is member-exclusivity with some add-ons for ordinary customers, not an open core offer with benefits for subscribers.The situation is made worse by the fact that you even list market prices for all of the wines, but it is not possible for a non-Angel to make their contribution to development etc by paying these higher prices rather than becoming a member, so there’s absolutely no point in listing them. Finally, all your vouchers default to automatic membership which it is then the customer’s responsibility to cancel, rather than offering an inducement and leaving it to the customer to opt into the preferential membership. The point here is that you are operating a default wine club/subscription service, whatever you want to call it, but are not being straight that this is the case. You draw customers to your site with the expectation of a wide range of exciting wines and then only allow them to have access to them by joining your club. That is what has caused frustration and dissatisfaction to me, and by the look of these reviews, to several other potential customers.It is, of course, your prerogative to reply to these points if you really want to, but I have now said all I have to say on the matter.
NakedWines	GB	I have just received my first 6 bottles…	22 May 2021	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	I have just received my first 6 bottles under an offer I saw on Facebook ... reading the trust pilot reviews I’m beginning to regret it ..... not sure what I’ve got myself into . I thought the £30 / month was a saving scheme and when you had over £100 in there you ordered a crate ...... it appears that isn’t the case  ..... so I don’t think I will be taking this any further

NakedWines	GB	Payment taken without an order being placed	19 May 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Today I cancelled my account and received confirmation. Unfortunately I had items in the basket, but didn’t proceed with placing an order. However, upon leaving the Angel scheme, Naked Wines, processed the basket, taking the money, without me actually proceeding with the order. I expect a full refund, given this money was taken without permission. Unacceptable behaviour and a rip-off. I will not return and shall warn friends and family to stay clear.

It’s great to see the good selection of wines and many offered. The communication from naked wines was brilliant. The naked wine app works really well. One think I feel could be looked at is the free delivery threshold.
NakedWines	GB	One star as cannot give Zero Stars.	18 May 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	One star as cannot give Zero Stars.refused to honour voucher sent to me as my wife had already used my credit card to purchase wines on a voucher sent to her. Told us it would amount to fraud.Have spent 2 frustrating days trying to sort it out and ended up cancelling both orders.their reply is frankly not acceptable as they say that I needed to provide my personal card details for them to accept my order, however the card details I gave WERE for my personal card, they were happy to accept my card details for an order by my wife so how can they say they need personal card details for an order.
NakedWines	GB	Happiest of Happy Angels	18 May 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	"I have been a member for about three years now and apart from wishing they'd upgrade their website so that you can just type in how many bottles of each wine you want, I am a very happy Angel.Why am I happy?Good choice of interesting winesSupport for independent growers and producersReasonable priceGood forum so that issues and recommendations can be shared Above all, the wonderful staff, working from home at present, but always a cheerful and helpful being on the end of the phone.  Just as well as the webchat bot isn't all that good! As an example I cite one of the few if not only, mistakes I have experienced. For some reason at Christmas I received a Christmas mixed case instead of the Deluxe Case.  A wonderful young man, obviously not dealing with the first such call, was nevertheless full of genuine apologies, made special arrangements to collect the case and ensure it was replaced with what I had ordered.  That would have been sufficient, especially as he made sure that collection and delivery times were convenient to us, with special instructions to collect the case direct as I have mobility issues and we live in a second floor flat. However, he also gave me compensation for the inconvenience added to my next order.  I have also noticed that if a wine has received a number of complaints, everyone who bought it gets a refund. Above all I loved the way Naked wines got involved to organise the Covid Rescue cases, which allowed us to support growers whose wine we would otherwise probably never have tasted.I don't recognise the Naked Wines as described in some of the poor reviews here. They seem to be mostly around a particular promotion.  Possibly because I didn't come to Naked Wines via a promotion, but on the recommendation of friends after another Wine Company (Majestic) manged to fail to deliver my Christmas wine despite having paid for a fixed time delivery.  Everyone said ""Should have gone to Naked Wines"" so I did. Cheers Ray and team"
NakedWines	GB	Oh dear	18 May 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Oh dear, this Angel thing is looking like it's out of control. I fear that this company will be getting themselves in some deep trouble.

NakedWines	GB	Naked Wines - Not Transparent and Disingenuous	17 May 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	"I received a reply from Ellie which actually does not answer the points I raised. Firstly it is quite clear that you state delivery is free on the letter. The voucher contradicts this as does your website. You even repeat and almost confuse the issue by restating that delivery with the referred to offer is free, when in fact it is not, unless the order is over £100 for future orders.Secondly. On completing the initial make a claim, you are committed to receiving emails etc as indicated. This may not be becoming a full 'angel' but it definitely implies membership of an organisation as to 'claim' I have to agree to receiving email offers and have my details retained for 3 months. That in anyone's language is membership.Thirdly, you maintain in the offer letter/voucher that Naked Wines and the 'Angel' system is not a 'Wine Club'. By your lack of refence to that point it's clear that you do not have an answer to that.Fourthly, the first response I received was a reply from a person called Lorna who apologised for ""any frustration' I'd received with the offer and website - that completely missed the point of my review and suggests that my review was not even properly looked at prior to reply. Maybe the system is 'autobot' operated and is not as personal as the company would lead users to believe.Fifthly, the next almost immediate response from your company was actually to question with 'TrustPilot' the veracity and authenticity of my 'customer interaction' with Naked Wines. Effectively, questioning my integrity, which is quite insulting to receive from a company allegedly interested in customer satisfaction.Rather than going to all these lengths with questioning customer integrity, seemingly automated responses and then a more personal response that actually doesn't answer any of the points referenced in my review and actually increases the contradictory nature of the marketing material.It'd make sense to fully review your questionable practices and show more transparency.Thank you.I decided to look at the reviews before deciding to proceed with the £30 Naked Wines voucher offer. Interestingly I paid a lot of attention to the company replies/comments to negative reviews. It is quite clear that Naked Wines are deliberately trying to mislead! Examples: The letter states ""To snap up your 6 bottles for £24.99, visit nakedwines  .  com /  dmrg05 - with free and contactless delivery to your doorstep"" The voucher states on the back of the mock cheque ""NEXT DAY delivery as standard only £4.99""If you check the FAQs on their website then it states that delivery is only £4.99  or free if you spend over £100.00So, contradictory, misleading at the outset and not good standard of communication or marketing!The rear of the £0 cheque voucher states ""NO requirement to join any wine 'clubs""If you check the FAQ on their website, it shows the definition of their 'Angel' under 'What's a Naked Wine Angel?"" Their answer clearly shows that it is ""are a very special group of people who support talented winemakers by saving from £25 a month from their next order........"" That answer is a direct definition of a 'club' and in particular to wine. Therefore, in anyone's language a 'Wine Club'.If you click on the link to 'make your claim' you will automatically become an 'Angel' so therefore a 'Wine Club' member. How do I know this, simply by reading the small print at the base of the claim box which states ""By hitting the button you're giving us permission to email your voucher plus 2 reminders, and to store your data for 3 months. In our privacy policy we explain how we'll keep it safe.""Again, totally misleading, totally contradictory.Would far prefer honesty and transparency as opposed to deliberate attempts to confuse and mislead. I've no idea if customers have found it difficult to get refunds/cancelled contracts from Naked Wines as I've not got that extra step into the system. But my experience of the operation based on their initial mailing and web experience suggests that the complaints could well be true! I'd avoid this operation as much as possible. If they're going to be so disingenuous from the initial mailing and then respond to complaints in the way they already have. As in 'sorry to hear......., then explain their policy, after people have signed up......'Then, you cannot really expect much in the way of quality and honest, transparent customer service afterwardsPoorly designed, inaccurate and disingenuous marketing material does not help any business. If Naked wines believe they have a quality business model, then they should be extolling those virtues in a honest, transparent fashion through their marketing material.If they continue along the same lines as they're currently doing then they deserve to be avoided."

Spighlty dearer than the supermarket wines, but of a far better quality. Also if you phone to resolve a problem they deal with it quickly and efficiently. The person on the other end of the phone could not have been more helpful.

You then have to answer some silly questions to actually get on the website. You are then asked to purchase wines you don't actually want and given a £ 30.00 voucher to spend on said wine !!! You then go on the website only to be told they don't sell the wine you actually googled in the first place.......total scam and my advice is avoid and keep the shops open !!!!!!!!!!!!
NakedWines	GB	Rubbish follow up	16 May 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	RubbishBeen trying to cancel my account and the something  Angel account for days. Re set password,  only get a robot reply.  Be aware they are taking  funds from my account  on original  card and they do not have authorisation.  Anyone know how to get out of this.No problems with the wine. Really good quality.  Just cannot  afford the savings account  at present. Thank you for sorting  this out. Well thankfully  I have received a reply. Sorry , people ,don't  want  you to take my money without  authorisation  on individual transactions , any time, anywhere mode. Don't  want  to talk to a robot.. I am not one. Funnily  enough I am a practising  Angel in real life, so far, so please just cancel account,  do not use my bank card. I have no quibbles about quality of  wines.
NakedWines	GB	I mistakenly signed up to become an Angel	15 May 2021	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	I mistakenly signed up to become an Angel but they quickly sorted that out for me and I was happy to try their initial offer at 24.99.The case duly arrived on the date and time promised.On opening the case I noticed that 3 of the bottles had screw on caps. I've drunk two of them and I poured the second bottle down the sink. I am not a connoisseur but I know what I like and so far I'm definitely not impressed with the quality of the wine.Other than that they seem a good honest company to deal with. I may try them again but probably not.

NakedWines	US	Super impressed!	15 May 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	They've been great!  Bought a selection of wines for my mom for Christmas and she said they were excellent. When Mother's Day rolled around I realized I made a mistake in cancelling my angel membership. NW was great about letting me join again. Ordered 9 for my mom and 12 for my wife and I. Happy to be a member again. Looking forward to ordering again soon. Fast delivery and customer service couldn't be nicer.
NakedWines	GB	BE WARY OF £24.99 OFFER	14 May 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	The nakedwines link dmgs05 takes you to a £30 off Voucher offer which might be expensive for you - see others posts to see their details and experience.Thank you to those people for alerting to this.The response just confirms that the £24.99 offer is not valid. I do not propose to waste more time reiterating what others have adequately stated.

NakedWines	GB	OFFER IN A LETTER NOT MATCHED ON-LINE	13 May 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Had a letter with an offer for £24.99 with free delivery and a specific web-link. Logged onto that link and could not find the offer as printed in the letter sent to me by Naked Wines. What was on offer was more expensive and no indication of free delivery. An email response talks about removing a link to an associated £30 voucher, logging back in, receiving a reset link etc; No thanks, the web-link in the letter for the £24.99 offer should have worked first time.

NakedWines	GB	Value for money	13 May 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	
NakedWines	GB	Dishonest Practice	13 May 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	"I have just purchased wine using a voucher on which it clearly states you do not need to join their wine club. Before I made the purchase I thoroughly read the T's&C's where it says the same and also that ""we will never take payment from your card unless you authorise us to do so"". There was no direct question when ordering as to whether I wish to join their wine club or not (which I do not). However, when I look into the details of the transaction on my credit card (on-line) it has been set up as a ""recurring"" transaction  and they have sent me emails welcoming me to their wine club so they obviously have every intention of making a monthly charge against my card. I have contacted my credit card and got this corrected so they can't.I note people have complained that they cannot be contacted by phone. Their number is in the T's and C's - 01603 281869"

Entered the web address into google - took me to the Naked Wine site where they wanted me to fill in a questionnaire to get £30 off. No sign of the offer. Why send me an offer and make it so difficult for me to get it. Wont bother again and I go through a case a week.
NakedWines	GB	Normally very good but the last Oder was a bit of a mess.	12 May 2021	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	I have bought from Naked Wines for May years and fount them very good but my last Oder was a complete mess.  I did not get the free loyalty gift and they sent me by default, with no order being placed some wine that I had expressed an interest in and asked to be notified when in stock but had not ordered.  To cap it all they then repeated the same order when I had in fact ordered a mixed case of wine.  All very disappointing.  I read somewhere they had been taken over so that may have something to do with the mess - a loss of focus on good service.

I was a subscriber but I cancelled my subscription for naked wines on last December 2020. But for my surprise today I got a notification from my bank saying Naked wines had deducted money, 52 pounds, from my account without my knowledge or any notification. Tried contacting Naked wines but there were no ways to reach there customer support. Feels terrible and dishaertened. Be careful about them.

Guess what happened? After I claimed my voucher, they auto-subscribed me to an Angel account with a pre-selected monthly payment of £25! Luckily I was cautious enough to check their ""subscriptions"" section after claiming the voucher so I haven't been charged £25, but still, it feels like they tried to trick me.P.S. I know, I know, there must've been some fine print or confusing popup that ""asked"" if I ""agree"" to this subscription, but c'mon guys - dark patterns is not the best way to build long-term customer loyalty."

After being provided with a tracking number with Yodel and a confirmation that my order was to arrive tomorrow, they decided to cancel it. Poor.
NakedWines	GB	Appallingly Devilish Customer Service	06 May 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	"Clearly I do not buy enough wines from Naked Wines AKA Majestic Wine. I am always late in taking up their ""free bottle of wine"" which is never available in spite of their marketing blurb driving me to the website to claim it! I am no Angel (although I commit a few quid every month to be one) and have never been able to make a successful claim but the fact they hold on to quite a bit of my money in advance of my purchases, does not hold any sway (in Heaven) when it comes to giving good customer service. I would be vary wary of this organisation and their confidence trickery. I am still waiting for the return of my money (hope I don't have to spend it to get all that free wine I've missed out on)! In the meantime, I hope they all go to Hell!"
NakedWines	GB	I cannot praise Naked Wines enough	06 May 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I cannot praise Naked Wines enough, I have been an 'Angel' for over three years (I joined in September 2017) and have only had one bad bottle which they refunded immediately.  I have only had one issue with Yodel which Naked Wines compensated for with a freebie bottle, and I have found their customer services (via email) exemplary.  They have a great range of wines from all over the globe and their website is really informative on every wine.  Their Christmas boxes are pretty good too.

I had just missed out on the next day delivery which they advertise - but I did order later on Friday afternoon. Monday 3rd comes along - email confirms Yodel has my consignment but now anticipated delivery of Tuesday 4th. No text/email to advise of the reason for the lateness - surely management can assess supply and demand and learn to apologise for late deliveries.  Getting it by/on Monday was particularly important for me - but I think I'll go back to Virgin Wines as I can trust them.  Sent a message to customer services - no reply.

My wife joined about a year ago and we order from them fairly frequently, never have we been disappointed in anything they’ve sent....just spectacular wines. And if you’re into gins, try their Rambla 41! Oh my, just too good. Important note, when you buy from Naked Wines you are supporting loads of little, artisan vineyards that simply can not complete with massive Californian, Australian or European monopolies. They operate on a shoestring compared to these yet manage to produce wines that are better than any of them..... really!Join Naked, enjoy the booze and support the small, wine producing communities!

NakedWines	GB	Excellent customer service but a failed delivery	01 May 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Following my review, I have to change it as Naked Wines did their best to deliver my order the day after the missed delivery.The wine is great, the customer service excellent.I was not delivered the day I was supposed to but Naked Wines made a great deal to make the delivery happened the next available day.So it's a big thank you.However, I have cancelled my angel membership and I will not take it back now. I lost 2 days to be delivered: the first delivery failed even though I cancelled all my commitments on the day to be sure to be at home for the delivery and the second time, I also stayed at home all day long to track the truck and when it was almost my time to be delivered, I went on the street to make sure that the deliveryman does not miss me.The deliverymand did not deliver me to my door, it was more like a pick up from his truck.So yes it is a five stars for your effort but it was too much effort from my side and I will not take a chance to have the same experienc.

NakedWines	GB	Disappointing wine	30 April 2021	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	Potential for a good service, but the wines we received were particularly average, despite the hype they were given by Naked wines. I normally shop at majestic and consistently get great wine there for the same price, if not less. In fact I’ve got better wine from Aldi than what we received.
NakedWines	GB	Lack of communication between NW and Yodel drivers	29 April 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	When I made the order, I specifically asked for the driver to ring my mobile phone when he got to my address and not to ring the bell because that’s the neighbour’s bell and it’s unsafe. The driver did exactly the opposite. So just want to say thank you for the delivery and for adding to the complications I have with my neighbours. Clearly I can’t trust Naked Wines or Yodel drivers so I won’t be buying from them again, even if theirs is the world’s best wine.
NakedWines	GB	Day -1 since delivery was expected	29 April 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	"Day -1 since delivery was expected, and despite assurances yesterday that ""the wines have been picked and should be sent to your local depot later today, for delivery with Yodel tomorrow"", the Yodel Tracker is still advising that it is ""waiting for the parcel"", and Naked Wines are unable to tell me where it actually is.  What is the point of ordering almost a week in advance and being able to select a delivery day, when this cannot be fulfilled?  Perhaps Naked Wines should instigate a 'lucky dip delivery system', at least this way, you will not be setting any expectations with your customers and won't be repeatedly letting them down.  Instead of crediting me back the price of two bottles, why not use this to pay for a same day delivery courier which will get my birthday present to the recipient, on their birthday!!!I'm hoping i won't have to post again on here tomorrow but i'm not that optimistic"

When I messaged them to see if there was anything they could do an agent called Laurel came back to me just to say sorry ""the couriers are taking longer than usual"".  I needed the delivery in 3 days time and so asked for a refund so I could use it to spend with another company.  I was expecting more than just ""ok thank you, your refund will be with you in 3-5 working days"" for a company who claim to value their members it was disappointing to leave on such a note."

The yodel man delivered it around 5pm,and I asked him about the signature, he hurried away and said no.When I opened the box I found that I was sent 12 red.The idea was for me to keep 6 white as I am not to fond of red, and give 6 red to the family.It looks like the family will now be receiving 12 red.I have cancelled my account due to delivery, and failure to send the correct order. Not a great start, in my dealings with Naked wines.

NakedWines	GB	Great wines and service	27 April 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I'm a new customer and have really enjoyed my experience with Naked Wines so far. The wines arrived safely. There were admittedly some substitutions...however the app allowed me to find out about the wines they had sent and the quality of the each wine was excellent.For me it was a more interesting experience than buying wine elsewhere as you can find out more about the winemakers.Reading other reviews, I don't know if it's changed since...but I found the monthly top of of my naked wines account very open and easy to understand during the whole process. It's like a savings account for wine, I would prefer saving for special occasions rather than a subscription model that just sent wine unnecessarily every month.
NakedWines	GB	First time customer	26 April 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	First time customer! Received  email saying my order had missed the delivery, they were very sorry but would get it out on the next delivery. Guess  what? It missed the second delivery as well! On top of that they send you an email  on the day of delivery - they must think we have nothing else to do, a couple of days notice would be better. My impression is that this is a company in trouble and trying  to survive. This will be my first and last order that is assuming I ever get itUPdate: Received an email advising the order has missed delivery for a third time!!! At this rate the wine will be very mature.

The last straw was that you sent me the wrong wine. When I requested collection of the unwanted bottles I received no communication from you. A Jodel driver just turned up unannounced to collect them. I reordered and they have not arrived as stated and Jodel have not got them yet. None of this is acceptable.After over 10 years with you I'm off. GoodbyeSteve
NakedWines	GB	Excellent business model and service	22 April 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I have been using Naked Wines for a while as I liked the business model and wanted to favour the growers rather than the huge supermarket chains who pay their suppliers as little as possible. It is just too easy to buy from the supermarket but you don't get any recommendations, it is just pot luck. Inevitably you end up buying the same wines because you can guarantee you will like them. Naked Wines website, recommendations, product reviews and winemaker profiles is just excellent. It makes you feel like you are connecting and rewarding 'real people' not a faceless conglomerate. Great job guys
NakedWines	GB	Great!	21 April 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I have been buying from Naked Wines for a year or so, and I do not have a single complaint. An intriguing selection of wines from around the world, and whenever I have run into an issue, they have dealt with it generously.I'd happily recommend Naked Wines to anyone (and have!).

A very friendly and professional approach to all aspects of their service, from ordering online to the delivery. Their wine selection is fantastic too. Thank you
NakedWines	GB	Highly Recommend	21 April 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I’ve used Naked wines for a while now. Orders almost always go smoothly and communication is always good. On odd occasions if there has been a delay or a mistake with my order, naked have always refunded me quickly and gone the extra mile to resolve any issues. I highly recommend
NakedWines	GB	Yet another order not gone to plan.	21 April 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	"Yet another order not gone to plan.place order 9/4/21 delivered 14/4/21, sent the wrong order.Still waiting for wine to be collected and they won't credit my account until they've received wine back, even when it's their mistake.So looks like its going to take 4 weeks + before i could reorder!!Latest updatenever received message from Lorna.22/4/21 wrong order collected 23/4/21 Georgia reordered my order placed on 9/4/21 with a message saying ""Would you like me to give you a call on Thursday(29th) just to make sure they arrived correctly?""29/4/21 message from Simon the delivery guy""I'm really sorry - there was a problem at our warehouse last night and your wines missed the last trailer to make it to your local delivery depot.""Unbelievable."
NakedWines	GB	Excellent service and great choices	20 April 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Excellent service and great choices. I have been a customer for a few years and I have no complaints. Every delivery has been spot on and accurate - one delivery even was due sooner thank I expected when I wasn’t due to be at home (remember those days?!) and even though it wasn’t their problem Naked helped quickly rearrange delivery for me. I love trying new wines and i have also signed up for several reserves of the next vintage for wines I especially like - I recover good notification of these becoming available and had the option at any time to change or pause the reserve order. I prefer putting a little away each month and then deciding on an order at any time - the Christmas wine boxes were excellent and had some brilliant options. It’s easy go choose a case already mixed or pick your own, keep track of what you like, connect with the wine makers and the wine community if you want to ask questions, or learn from others. I have to say, I found it very clear about what becoming an Angel entailed, and it’s possible to change your mind at any time - you are not trapped into a subscription or club that you can’t get out of. I am a happy Angel!
NakedWines	GB	Good wines, excellent customer service	20 April 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I've been a very happy customer with the Naked Wines experience for three years now;  in my most recent delivery one of the bottles was wrong - i.e. they had accidentally substituted a wine I had not ordered.  My complaint was dealt with quickly, generously and in a very friendly way.A tip: if you're thinking about joining up, and you like Shiraz and Cab Sauv type wines, try the Arabella reds .... superb tipples for a very nice price.
NakedWines	GB	Cheers here's to happy tasting.	20 April 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	the site is user friendly so easy to use
NakedWines	GB	Been with Naked for 11 years, not the company they were.	20 April 2021	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	Been with Naked wines for 11 years and had previously been great. Went down hill a bit when it was bought. Dropped of a cliff in the COVID period. I have had problems with missing bottles and delayed deliveries. When you do book a delivery you can wait up to a week for a slot. If you want quick accurate deliveries this is no longer the company for you.
NakedWines	GB	Wines excellent. Watch out for £20 taken pcm thereafter.	20 April 2021	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	Their wines are and delivery is excellent.  However be careful and keep an eye on your bank accounts after initial payment.  Despite  having asked the question “is this a one off payment” and “will you take any other monies after this initial payment” and being told it was a one off and no other monies would be deducted- I had £20 pcm taken from my card.  I only found deduction by chance.  I called Naked Wines.  My account was cancelled immediately and I am assured refunds are in place to come back to me.  In short wines excellent but watch your bank accounts thereafter.  Excellent customer service when I found out.  Would have been five stars but for the taking of the monies.EDITCaira helped brilliantly.   Sorted everything.  Your customer service is excellent. Monies refunded and received.  Excellent service. So polite.

NakedWines	GB	Never had a correct delivery	16 April 2021	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	I’ve had 4 deliveries, everyone of them has either been late, wrong wines, or both late and wrong wines! Nice enough on the phones but seriously...... a wine delivery company and they fail at the first hurdle.... delivering wine!!!
NakedWines	GB	Wine ok..service not ok	16 April 2021	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	Yet again delivery delayed due to stocktake! They seem incapable of understanding any emails sent to them and just reply with meaningless platitudes. The Times Wine Club does not seem to have this problem so why does Naked ? All this and a constant barrage of emails asking you to buy wine that they struggle to deliver. Had enough now which is a shame as the actual wine is good. Subscription cancelled.

Sorry Naked since you have got bigger you have got so bad with deliveries, patience has run out. Shame because I enjoyed most of the wines.You have now lost a good customer.

Very poor service  and I hate the fact that I’ve been lied to how can I trust my money to this company in the future
NakedWines	GB	Naked Wines are complete disigenuous…	16 April 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Naked Wines are complete disigenuous thieves that think it's ok to mislead their customers into using a wine voucher to purchase wines when in reality you automatically get signed up to something you did not have knowledge of or even consent to, where your hardearned money is automatically taken out of your bank account continuously (every £20) which is nothing but a scam, against Data Protection and feels like fraud. I've called to demand a refund since they stole £80 and claimed it was going to a 'savings account' and said that it would take 3-7 days for a refund. I even cancelled my membership too since I get nothing but spam emails from them. I'm hoping I get my money back, if not then my bank along with law enforcement will be made aware.
NakedWines	GB	Great site to use	15 April 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Great site to use. Good selection of wines to choose from. Helping wine makers around the world.

The wine is lovely and very reasonably priced, and if you're an angel you get a discount. I would recommend becoming an angel as you have nothing to lose and it doesn't cost anything only a deposit into your wine account every month,  and.... now again you get a really nice freebie
NakedWines	GB	Get Naked and enjoy good wine	15 April 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I am not a wine 'expert'. I have always enjoyed wine but like most folk bought my wine from the local supermarket, and had no problem with the wine I bought. I was not into wine clubs. However, with an introductory £75 off a case of wine, i thought I would give Naked Wines a try. Well I have got to say that , so far, I am over the moon with the wines I have tried. All the wines have been excellent. French, Portugese, S African, Italian, every one has been a winner. I was sceptical initially, but now would recommend anyone to give Naked wines a try.

NakedWines	GB	Feel totally conned!!	14 April 2021	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	Had a voucher with my purchase of a mobile through BT.  The voucher stated it did not involve 'signing up' to a subscription account.  When went online to try and use voucher only option seemed to be to sign up to their monthly subscription account.  Ordered the 12 bottles of wine with supposedly 75% off price.  Was signed up to monthly subscription.  Wine worked out around £5 per bottle.  Before order came notified to say some wines weren't in stock and had been changed.  Wine came - cheapest possible wine sent - about same as supermarket price I would have paid.  no obvious way to cancel monthly subscription on website.  Went through automated help and managed to get someone to cancel subscription through that :-)  1 star changed to 2!!!
NakedWines	GB	Great wine shame about their customer service	13 April 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Great wine, all is good while you are making monthly payments. Heaven help you if anything goes wrong with your order customer services are truly shocking
NakedWines	GB	"Received a ""cheque"" to allow money off…"	12 April 2021	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	"Received a ""cheque"" to allow money off my first order. The wine was fine 6 white and 6 red and all appeared to be reasonable value and I was now called an ""Angel"". Then I started receiving emails from Naked Wine inviting me as an ""Angel"" to donate money to various projects that they were associated with. Not just one email but three in the first week asking for money. I joined Naked Wines to enjoy good wines at bargain prices but it was more than that, they wanted more money. My wife and I are involved in some relevant charities and organisations through our professions and we support them financially. I don't know if somehow Naked Wines thought that we were a soft touch but sadly I had to stop my membership. The email response I received from them started off: ""I am sorry to hear that this isn't the kind of email and news you are interested in and I'm sorry to hear you feel this way.""  Nothing like guilt tripping and making a potential good customer feel bad is there. The Wine is fine the emails are offensive. BEWARE."
NakedWines	US	Naked Wines really is a nice concept in…	11 April 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Naked Wines really is a nice concept in action. They bring in independent wineries and offer their members a good value for regular purchases. This lets the producers have a regular base to create wines for beside their regular sales. Some of the talented wine makers once worked for large companies and are now doing independent production.The wine regions, types and quality vary. If something is way off they will make it right.. but in fairness to the producers if drinkable best to enjoy. Nothing is perfect and surprise is part of the fun of being in a wine club.Some of the best selections are Italian reds, California Chardonnay's and Chenin Blanc's, Napa Valley Cabernet's, Argentinian Malbec's.  When you see your favorites, they could be here today, gone tomorrow, so don't wait.Another tip, for strong reds, don't drink too soon if young. Or decant if on the young side. Whites are typically always ready to drink.Membership and it's offerings are optional and can be cancelled at any time.  The frequency of your account and monthly contribution can be adjusted if you contact customer service and are not using as often. They are very accommodating. Just have some patience.  I've seen people panicked over the membership contribution debit. Its easy to cancel if not for you. For many it's a well rated wine club, with some surprisingly good wine values, and a nice website to interact and get feedback from other members on wines.

NakedWines	GB	Fantastic company, great wine, great service	09 April 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Fantastic company, I have really enjoyed their wine and service though lockdown. A fantastic range of wines at great prices. Customer service is fantastic, when I have missed out on the monthly free sample I have had a credit applied to my account alongside compensation on the 2 occasions my delivery has been briefly delayed.Can't recommend them enough, pay in every month to build up credit and then spend as and when you want.Wines are really top notch too and there is good interaction with the wine makers themselves also which I really like

NakedWines	GB	Doesn't do what it says on the tin	08 April 2021	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	I've been an angel for a while (for the second time) but the service has changed and so has the overall package.  Unfortunately this is the second poor review I've written, I should have learned from previous poor customer service!They have turned into a 'bot' driven, non-customer focused organisation.  My initial query with their customer service has turned into a complaint as I was initially taken in by their web chat service (warning, you are not talking to a real person who can do anything) and then patronised when I did make contact.Angel 'free samples' are not free samples when they are throw in as part of a package.  They are just that, part of the package.  However this part of the package now appears to be time limited to certain times of the month.  I thought I missed it in the small print but having reviewed this I must have missed it in the even smaller print.I'm now sticking elsewhere.  Whilst I may have paid a 'membership fee', I now just pay for the wine I order, good quality at competitive rates, when I want it with no subscription fees.Edit following response.  'Corrinne' has asked for extra details yet she has managed to email me too.  If Naked Wines would hate to see me leave why not align what you claim with the reality.  Oh, and get rid of the bots.
NakedWines	GB	Delayed delivery excuses	07 April 2021	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	"Since change of ownership things are going down hill. Order pages still talk of next day delivery until order is made and then confirmation e mail states a wait of a week ""which can't be brought forward"". Strange since Corrinne from Naked Wines was only replying on this site to another customer four days ago apologising that after teething problems with new warehouse they were back to their usual level of service - well that return  to service either only lasted four days or their usual level of service is to advertise next day delivery but wait a week until the next day is identified."

NakedWines	GB	Hidden regular cost they won’t cancel	03 April 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	They offer discounted wines, hide in the small print of that it means they will take money from you automatically. When you ask to cancel they continue to take the money anyway.It’s one thing to bury something in the t and cs - I should have read after all. But it’s another to just continue to take the money after being told to stop and saying you can cancel at anytime.Nice wine but Does not behave like a proper business should.
NakedWines	GB	Amazing wine and good customer service	02 April 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Amazing wine and good customer service. I can’t believe I’m reading reviews about complaints. Well. Maybe I can. It’s the people that are just after a cheap wine deal. Not reading what naked wines is about and the terms and conditions. I find it a bit harsh giving a bad review just because of your own ignorance. Maybe you should stick to Sainsbury’s or Tesco for your over priced wine and keep your opinions to yourselves. I’ve been using naked wines for a year now and have tasted the most amazing wines for a fraction of the price in supermarkets. Customer services has also never been an issue. Keep up the good work and continue supporting the wine makers across the world

NakedWines	GB	No Customer service	01 April 2021	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	Having under the previous management rated Naked wine as 5* and not lightly having joined over 8 years ago and staying loyal to their support of small growers.However since the change in management and a new warehouse my last 2 orders have included lost bottles, late delivery and a case of 6 unexpected wines.  The response of the customer 'service' team was dismissive to the point of insulting hello Nicola and Byrony.  I am done with the new naked- my recommendation grab a promotion case and run.I sent additional info - still waiting for a response.  I also sent a case back on 7 April and am still waiting for a refund.  No online chat available just a stupid bot named after a snack.1*
NakedWines	IE	Fabulous wines, fantastic company	01 April 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	The wines from Naked Wines really are top notch. We have tried and loved so many of them. The Christmas Box was particularly lovely. They regularly have online events for wine lovers, and updates from the wine makers so you feel really close to the process and valued as a customer. The wine is the same price as supermarket wine but 100 times better. I like that the subscription money stays in your account as well until you are ready to order a case

NakedWines	GB	Wine buying made easy	01 April 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	The only people who seem to be complaining about naked wines are people who want free / cheap wine by using and sometimes abusing the introductory offer voucher. Seriously. It's clearly stated that by signing up for the offer you are subscribing if not cancelled within a certain timeframe. This applies to just about every subscription trial you sign up for - it's not unique to naked wines! I've kept my subscription rolling for over a year now. You can choose how much you want to pay each month, anywhere from £10 at the moment but the usual default (pre pandemic) is £20. This is banked up and can be spent at any time on a massive range of wines. You can buy wines from as little as £6.99. I tend to buy within the £9 to £12 bracket- you can buy to suit your budget. You can rate the wines that you've purchased which is handy, because Naked can then recommend you other wines that you might also like.There's a whole community that you can interact with (or not), including the wine makers themselves.If at any point you change your mind, for whatever reason, you can either reduce your subscription price, pause payments from 1 to 3 month, or cancel your membership. Cancelling results in any left over money in your account being refunded back to your bank. Yes it's that simple. Don't be put off by people upset that they couldn't abuse the voucher scheme, or people horrified that they have to PAY for wines that they SIGNED UP FOR via a subscription service.I recommend Naked Wines to anyone who gets fed up of standing in the supermarket looking at the same wines week in week out. Use Naked, you get more variety, you get a range of prices, you get recommendations and you can get next day delivery.
NakedWines	GB	I thought the initial offer of wine was…	30 March 2021	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	I thought the initial offer of wine was quite good, however i didnt realise i was signing up to a fixed fee every month.  I must have missed thatI spotted another discounted offer on line and used it but got an email back cancelling my purchase because i had used a discount voucher before.So i sent a discount voucher to my son so he could order some wine and told him i would buy it for him.  He got an email back rejecting his voucher because i had used my card to pay for it.  This is by my standards bad practice for a company to cancel orders because someone has used discount vouchers that have been sent to them.  Totally embarrassing.  Ive now closed my account
NakedWines	GB	The initial discount on six bottles was…	29 March 2021	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	"The initial discount on six bottles was very welcome. They were good wines. However trying to disentangle myself from Naked Wines is like trying to find the exit from IKEA ! I emailed them several times to remove me and stop receiving emails, but they want me to engage in a ""find the exit"" game..."
NakedWines	GB	Disappointed,	29 March 2021	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	had a voucher and though I would try ordering from naked wines, delivery worked well, the wines were ok, not good not bad, but was disappointed to find I have become a member/angel and the subscription was being taken from my account, this hopefully will be refunded but it was not made clear to me that this would happen.
NakedWines	GB	Rip off Subscription	28 March 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	The subscription was not made clear in the introductory offer. The company then took payments from my account without notification

NakedWines	GB	Sneaky £25 a month to be an 'Angel'	28 March 2021	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	After one purchase (test drive red case) I fell into the clandestine trappings of not fully reading the relentless emails about being a 'Nakedwines Angel'. Being an Angel means that Naked wines remove (in my case) £25 a month from your account for you to spend whether you like it or not. I was very satisfied with my first purchase but it's then my choice if I want to buy more. A bit like Amazon Prime there was probably a button I should have clicked to not be an Angel but I must have missed it. Either way, I don't like this forced way of buying using words like 'Angel' and 'Wings'. Such a shame really because I liked the wine.

NakedWines	GB	Not good quality of wine	24 March 2021	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	I tried Naked wines back in December and while I can't complain about the customer service or delivery, unfortunately the quality of wine is not so good. For what is the asking price, I was expecting much better quality but I have to admit that I could taste more sulphites than anything. Unfortunately I think the quality is the same as the shops. I have switched to another company that offer similar services for similar prices and I admit that wines meet my expectations.

NakedWines	GB	Superb customer service from Henriette!	22 March 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I received my test package today and found that I had been given two whites and four red wines were missing, so my order was only ten bottles instead of 12. I spoke to a lovely lady called Henriette and she was so helpful with regards to refunding the difference for the four red missing and giving me a £10 on my account and saying I could keep the white if I wanted. In the middle of our conversation we got disconnected, but immediately Henriette called me straight back and we carried on sorting out my query. It is unfortunate that there was a mistake with my order but these things happen and the way that the situation was dealt with was excellent and very professional with a nice little chat too. I cannot praise Henriette enough for her help today and although I cancelled my subscription to become an Angel, it is definitely something I will consider in the future after sampling. Thank you for your help today and I look forward to trying the wine this weekend - even the white wine! Henriette is a credit to your team! Kind regards.

We have never been disapointed yet we've never had a bad wine and we just order random mixed cases . The big difference we have noticed especially is that supermarket reds always have me a headache the next day even if I only had one glass this no longer happens so I can only assume it's the quality that makes the difference . I wouldn't hesitate to recommend naked wines The wine choice is superb the quality is excellent and the company ethos in helping new wine makers is to be commended

NakedWines	GB	Premier Crew	18 March 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I have now been with Naked Wines for over three years and I'm extremely pleased with their service. The wines I tend to buy work out at around £10.00 a bottle and plenty of them were so good, I could reasonably have expected to pay more than double that for them.There is also a free gift included with each order, which is usually a magnum of good quality wine and that effectively brings down the price per bottle.Ordering is simple, dispatch is quick and so far problem free.The fact that Naked Wines funds start-ups for small volume wine makers,  is an added incentive to subscribe.Can't praise them highly enough.

Became an ""angel"", got a discounted case, out of which 2 good wines and the rest the typical supermarket plonk they so much deride.Ordered a case of the Best at £17 a bottle, and received a case of port at £10 a bottle. Sent an email thinking it was a genuine mistake. It was not answered so on calling after an interlude exchange with a robot, eventually chatted with a ""real"" person who admitted that since the wine I had ordered was out of stock, they filled the case with a ""replacement"".At £7 per bottle difference this is a nice little racket. The margins are just lovely! This is a typical bait and switch sweatshop, or to put it more bluntly a fraud. I have asked for a full refund and cancelled my account. But as a fallen angel I am not holding my breath. Though it would be interesting to pursue this legally because this is obviously a business model."

They confirmed that white wine blend and chardonnay is their definition of ""essential white wines."" Apparently, every variety of white is all in the same bottle. If you like wine, don't order from Nakedwines. As I now say ""if it seems too good to be true, it's probably white wine blend."""

NakedWines	GB	Good customer service	10 March 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Very good customer service, I was disappointed to get only 7 different wines in a mixed case of 12 despite the site offering 8. They got in touch with me to fix it and offer a solution which was great, would recommend. Make sure you read the terms etc when you sign up.
NakedWines	GB	Naked Wines, Excellent!	10 March 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I discovered Naked Wines a couple of years ago after a referral from a friend. The wine they provide is truly delicious and the service is excellent. Just one out of the many bottles I received was not to my liking, I simply emailed them and they re-credited my account with a refund. I love the fact I can save my £20 per month and this is then put towards the next case I buy. I would highly recommend Naked Wines to any wine lovers out there!

NakedWines	GB	Not a best quality wines compared with…	08 March 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Not a best quality wines compared with other wine delivery companies.Did had few nice bottles but majority not as good. Was trying to leave for few months as was a lot of wine I didn’t like so got offered wine advisor to help me choose wines . I did ask my case to be mainly Cabernet souvignon and Prosecco  did told wine advisor that he doesn’t need to email me what I am getting as I trust him,and also been told about 100% no quibble guarantee.My case arrived and only one bottle of wine was pure Cabernet souvignon and no Prosecco. No quibble guarantee is lie as already spend over in hour on the phone wasting my time and getting stressed only to be told that I can’t get my money back for wine I didn’t like and that they ring me back today regarding if I would be able getting wine credit back . Nobody rang me back and I still didn’t received wine credit back. Looks like a long fight ahead including consumer rights as they do have false advertisement.

Delivery is always seamless and the one time we had an issue Naked Wines just sent us a new box.Fantastic experience! And the one is so much better than the one you can get at the supermarket....
NakedWines	GB	Hidden subscriptions and unexpected orders	06 March 2021	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	"As soon as I ordered for the first time Naked wines created an Angel account that involved a monthly payment. I had no idea of it as I don't usually read all in the information on the screen. This type of business model is also called dark UX as businesses rely on the customers not seeing these details. When I tried to cancel the subscription I couldn't unless i called them. Furthermore, I chose the option ""Reserve the next vintage"" for a wine that was out of stock and months later I received an email that my order is due soon.  I would have preferred if I was notified that the wine is back in stock so that I could place the order myself instead of rushing to cancel an order I didn't know I submitted by choosing this option. My advise would be to fix the user experience in their website and avoid hidden orders."
NakedWines	GB	Do not entertain this company	06 March 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Ordered introductory wine offer from Naked wines around 9th Feb, I cancelled the account on 19th Feb. They confirmed my account was closed & payment details deactivated. This company then proceeded to take money from my account on 2nd March. On emailing them they informed me of the wonderful benefits of being a wine angel but didn't offer to give me my money back. Unsure, how this is possible considering they told me they cancelled my account on 20th Feb.

NakedWines	GB	Voucher waste of time - be honest about Angels up front	06 March 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	"The omnipresence of NW ""offers"" has always raised my suspicions. However I did waste my time trying to apply  a £75 voucher today - time I will never get back! It clearly states on the voucher ""NO (their capitals) requirement to join any wine ""clubs"""" Get £75 off a case of wine priced £114.99 or more""It's a ruse to get you to sign up for a monthly subscription to their Angels non-club ha ha.Sticking with the Wine Society - Google them!"
NakedWines	GB	Great company, great wines	06 March 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I joined naked wines a couple of months ago on the recommendation of friends. So far they've been excellent. I wouldn't expect to necessarily love every single wine I select, but I've happily drunk them all and some have been wonderful. The customer service has been faultless and - in contrast to some of the other reviews - I've found the whole process to be transparent, clear and ethical. I like the way they invest in independent family growers. Deliveries have all been correct and on time. I'd certainly recommend naked wines.
NakedWines	GB	A complete shambles	05 March 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Have to say I am mystified at the overall score for this organisation. I placed my first order and asked for it to be delivered on Saturday - I was in work yesterday Thursday - and got a text to say the wine was going to be delivered at a time when there was no-one in. I was lucky a neighbour took the case in, but I was not happy. When I raised this with Naked Wines they said the day you choose is an estimate - what good is that?Today I had an email to say my delivery was due later in the day - it was delivered yesterday! I spoke to Naked Wines and they said it was  a Yodel mistake - it wasn't.NW rang back to say it was a mistake and an order had been sent out to me by mistake. So much inconvenience. If you get a voucher from them I would chuck it in the recycling or rip it up. They're clearly inept and don't know what they are doing.
NakedWines	GB	Great so far....	05 March 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Placed my initial introductory order which was received quickly and was excellent. Second order, as an official angel, placed for a largely different selection and have had the same result.Excellent communication from Naked and the winemakers so far plus very quick delivery and (most importantly) delicious wine at a great price.

NakedWines	GB	Old-school scam...	04 March 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	"Received a £75 voucher from naked wines for being a key worker. Registered my details with their site and tried to check out. You have to spend £114.99 or more on wine to get ""£75 free""- so... not actually free. You still have to pay in excess of £39.99, and then pay delivery in addition to that. Waste of my time. Just order from Tesco, so much less hassle."
NakedWines	GB	Absolutely outrageous.	04 March 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	"Absolutely outrageous.I have cancelled my ""wings"" after my first discounted order and reading the reviews. But now I've realised they kept taking the money from my account anyway. They made it impossible to remove credit card from their website before adding another one first. Never again, avoid at all costs.Edit, answer to reply: I'm glad to see naked wines finds the time to reply on trustpilot but not to my emails. I never signed up by mistake and I've cancelled two days after purchase.I have email proving the cancellation. Ridiculous. I dont think anyone is stupid enough to sign up by mistake, but thank you."
NakedWines	GB	Overall a good experience!	03 March 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Overall, I had a very good experience with Naked Wines. I had a voucher which gave me money off a 12 bottle crate, so I opted for the mixed red selection. The majority were really nice wines and I’ve definitely found a few that I’d buy again, but also there were a couple which just weren’t to my taste, as to be expected with a random selection, but my husband saw to those! For anyone saying Naked Wines is a scam company, they’re wrong. They clearly didn’t read the small print or email that they were sent explaining that after a month, they become ‘angels’ and are entered into their monthly subscription. I unfortunately had to stop any subscription with them due to financial issues, but I’m very pleased with the wines that I received and tried! :)
NakedWines	GB	Very doggy company! Will never buy from them again.	03 March 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I got an introductory voucher and ordered my first case of 12 a month ago, and today I found they secretly charged £20 from my account. There is no information about this monthly fee will be charged when you sign up on their website (or maybe hidden very very well somewhere). I've just requested a refund and let's see how this will go.The wines were ok, but the practice is so doggy and nasty. Avoid ordering from them!
NakedWines	GB	First wines tasted from my 12…	02 March 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	First wines tasted from my 12 introductory bottles very disappointing.  Flabby unbalanced reds from Chile and Argentina.  Hoping for better things but not holding up much hope. My £5 bottle of Douro from Aldi much much better!
NakedWines	US	Just be honest and upfront about the 25…	02 March 2021	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	Just be honest and upfront about the 25 quid charged to your card later when you sign up initially and give customers a clear choice. It was hidden and very annoying. I may well have stayed and purchased regularly if it wasn’t for this - classic way to kill a subscription business.
NakedWines	GB	Avoid	02 March 2021	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	I signed up with an introductory voucher it doesn't say anywhere on the website that £25 a month would be charged to your bank card.  It suggests it will give you £25 credit to claim as a discount against your next order.  Also,I orded a case of mixed red wine but 6 of them were white wine. I know I can send them back but would have preffered what I ordered.
NakedWines	GB	Don't sign up to this its a con	01 March 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Don't sign up to this its a con. I took the introductory offer and scoured the website to see if i had to cancel anything as I didn't want another case as need to cut back. Theres nothing on there that says they'll be taking another £20 and they didn't contact me to say they were they just did. I recon the good trust pilot reviews are by paid people.

NakedWines	GB	Big fan	26 February 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Have been an angel for quite a few years. Apart from really good wines, an app that adds value and provides interesting insights they also have an outstanding customer service. I have not had one interaction where an agent or a rep seemed disinterested in assisting me. I am posting this because their delivery service lost my case, and have not updated me once after I complained.  Naked sent me daily updates, and sorted out replacement case with a bonus attached. I'm a fan. Also their wines are amazing
NakedWines	US	Don't ever buy from Naked Wines	26 February 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Don't ever buy from Naked Wines. Even if you don't choose the membership but just want a one time purchase they will still charge you every month for the membership. They make it difficult to cancel and when you finally get it canceled instead of refunding you they will sneak in another charge. Calling them does no good because they will just insist that they already refunded you and that you and your bank are lying about the additional charge they made.

NakedWines	GB	No such thing as a free lunch	24 February 2021	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	Seduced by an offer forwarded by one of the charities I support I ordered a sampler case of white wines. Listed at around £10 a bottle these worked out at less than half of that which was, I would suggest, about their real value. I sampled a bottle of all the selections offered and failed to find a single one with any real character or quality. To me they tasted no better (or worse for that matter) than the budget wines typically stocked by major supermarkets. That said I had no trouble cancelling my membership and, on raising my concerns, was promptly issued a refund for half of the contentious case as a goodwill gesture.

NakedWines	GB	Superb	24 February 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Don’t really need a longer title.We have been with them for some months now, and the service has been first class.The website is easy and informative to use, and orders made dispatched and received as promised and as described. I particularly like the ‘Angel’ option, which not only works well for me as I save some money each month in advance to spend on wine, but helps out the independent wine producers, too.The wines are really interesting and most importantly the ones we have tried taste good also. I was getting so sick of the supermarkets routine of buying wine, with boring and predictable choices in the main. Naked Wines have made choosing and buying wine fun again.Based on my experience, I would have no hesitation whatsoever in fully recommending Naked Wines to others. None of those off putting tied-in commitments you don’t want and getting wine sent you didn’t order I have found with some other online wine companies in the past. Just great wines and great service.

NakedWines	GB	waste of my time.	22 February 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I received from a seller a £75 voucher for Naked Wines. As instructed on the voucher, I purchased a case of wine off Naked Wines website. I applied the voucher and the discount was deducted. I was advised by the website that my email was already in use. I applied to reset my email password. This was successful and my order came up but without the discount. I contacted Naked Wines and was informed that as I had already used a voucher in 2018, this voucher was not applicable. I as advised to look at the VERY small print on the BACK of the voucher. What a waste of everyone's time.

We quickly found out that 90% of their wines are only available to customers who put £20 per month into a deposit for their site and were left to chose from a very tiny range of wines just to realise that we had to order 6 bottles as otherwise they wouldn't deliver! Basically, we had to order cheap wine we don't like just to get past their 6 bottle limit. I highly recommend finding a different online wine shop!

I find the wine choices somewhat limited. I can't be bothered with the usual sauvignon blanc selection you can get that anywhere. I've stuck with a handful of good growers who make very good wine. Once in a while you get a free bottle thrown in. Service is normally pretty good and prices ok.

NakedWines	GB	£75 Discount Voucher	18 February 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	"So I got a £75 discount with an order that I placed with a separate company and thought I might as well give it a shot. Placed order for the mixed case then realised I had been signed up to the ""Angels"" club which requires a monthly deposit. I do not drink that much wine so opted out but this was pretty easy to do on the website.Wine eas delivered on the day specified when placing the order (only 2 days later) and all was fine.Quality/taste of the wine was also decent. Nothing to be blown away by but decent none the less.There are a lot of negative reviews on here because of the business model that the company is operating and the perceived hidden element of the monthly deposit. I would say this is unfair as they have fulfilled my expectations and more but I would agree, the ""Angels"" club sign up could be made more obvious when joining. I will continue to order sporadically from the company due to my needs but if you know what you are signing up for and how to opt-out if you desire I would recommend this company."
NakedWines	GB	Sounds a bit like joining a club!	18 February 2021	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	I used a voucher to try Naked Wines. It said on the voucher that I would not be required to join any clubs, but when I bought my fist case of wine I found that I had been automatically enrolled with Angels. That seems enough like a club to make my hackles rise. Also this did not appear on my billing page even though I had committed to pay £20 per month. I could not find a way of unsubscribing on my account pages so I wrote to customer services who sent a link.On the plus side the case arrived in less than 24 hours and the first bottle of wine is good. However I won't be using Naked Wines again as I feel that I was duped!
NakedWines	GB	No refund into your bank account	18 February 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	So far the two wines from the case of 6 I have tried are awful.

NakedWines	GB	Poor quality wines	18 February 2021	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	Was really disappointed with the quality of the 6 bottles of wine I’ve received. I thought I’d be receiving quality reds and have to say they were completely uninspiring. I normally get my wines from Lidl, normally the recommended ones they store in the wooden cases, some have been superb and priced extremely reasonably. I found the wines you’ve supplied lacked quality. Sorry guys, but I’ve now cancelled my subscription. If they had of been better quality then I’d have been happy to stay, but I’ll stick to Lidl’s vastly superior reds.

NakedWines	GB	Great company	15 February 2021	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	Hi Guys,I am very happy to be part of this amazing company. I already have a favourite wine producer and have had the pleasure of tasting many of this person's wines. However, I have had 2 Christmas boxes, and being a single person, I have a big problem with spirits, beers and bubblies! It's sad that I can't enjoy these so much owing to the fact that I take up to 2 weeks to drink a bottle of wine. Saying that, I don't drink spirits, except of course whisky.Please understand that this is my personal opinion. This is a great company, so what are you waiting for, join up and enjoy.

NakedWines	GB	A Six Month Review	14 February 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I have been a member for around half a year and have thoroughly enjoyed the experience. I have tasted some sensational wines that have been favourably priced, and, have liked the idea that more of the selling price goes to the producer than is normally the case at other outlets. There have only been one or two wines that I have not accorded with my taste, but I would have expected a similar outcome should I have tried a new wine elsewhere in the same time span. A new tasting can be a real find or something to shun thereafter. With Naked Wines, so many times it has been a joy. Last words, always a pain free transaction and prompt delivery, even during these stressful times. Naked Wines --- cheers to you!

This is the second time I have been through this process as my computer had remembered a password.  Gave up last time too.

NakedWines	GB	The best wine club I have come across	14 February 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	An excellent range of wines and some great savings available. They have a high standard of customer service and I like the fact that they are not all about making money, but give some away to charities too. If you are not sure what to select their suggestions are always helpful. They know their stuff but don't take themselves too seriously, and they reward customer loyalty.

NakedWines	GB	Terrible wines - and they'll keep taking your money even when you tell them not to	13 February 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	"Terrible company, nasty wines - and they will keep taking your money even when you tell them not to (I'm not convinced that's legal).This is what happened to me.I received a money-off voucher from Naked Wines and so thought I'd try a case.I'm not a wine snob but the wines were, frankly, nasty.I 'unsubscribed' by email, thinking I was closing my account with them. It didn't actually close nor 'unsubscribe' my account.What I also didn't realise - because they really do not make it clear - is that when you buy wines you become a subscriber. They take £20 a month from you.After a couple of months, I realised that they were taking money via my credit card. So, I ordered some more wine to use up my balance, which they'd taken from my credit card.I also emailed and and told them I didn't like their wines, to stop taking money and to close my account. My words were: ""I'd now like to cancel my subscription: please stop charging my credit card monthly."" I think that's pretty clear.Naked Wines wrote back and suggested they take £10 a month instead!I replied to say that some of their wines were ""close to undrinkable"" and ""What I'd really like is for you to cancel my account"" - again, it's clear.I have just realised, three months later, that they're still taking £20 every month!I've tried to remove my credit card details from their site - that's not possible.I've emailed them again to tell them to stop taking my money and cancel my account. I've contacted my credit card company to set up a dispute.Avoid Naked Wines like the plague - unless you want endless hassle, horrible wines and your money to be taken from you without your permission."
NakedWines	GB	Not a happy bunny	13 February 2021	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	My first time using this company. Was so far impressed with the wines and prices so was looking forward to giving them my business. I put in an order to specifically come today as I am throwing a valentines party for me and my hubby today. I don’t want to go out as I am high risk which is why I’ve ordered everything online. I received an email today to say there was a problem with the warehouse and my parcel did not get added on and it will be with me soon usually a day. If I order something to come a particular day I expect them to do as what I’ve requested scene as I am paying for a service. The email of should be a day is very brief, should be a day? So am I getting my parcel tomorrow on a Sunday or not at all. Very disappointed- can’t leave a review about the actual wine as it’s not here!
NakedWines	GB	I would happily award 5 stars, but...	13 February 2021	Rated 3 out of 5 stars	I would happily award 5 stars, however, they lose 2 in the same way they lost my business.Naked Wines are in fact a superb company in almost every way - the only way they fail is by their choice of courier: Yodel.Yodel, by far, are the worst courier firm (even worse than Hermes!).  Naked Wines lost my business when Yodel lose 2 cases of wine (how?!) and Yodel refused to drop at a collection point because Yodel stated that contents can go missing. I didn't believe this, but when my Nespresso order arrived - guess what, the parcel was opened and coffee sleeves were missing.Sorry Naked Wines, if only you used a trustworthy courier...
NakedWines	GB	Naked Wines...	13 February 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Excellent quality wines offered at an affordable price to all.
NakedWines	GB	Thoroughly recommended	12 February 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Naked Wines have a brilliant business concept, enabling small winemakers to bring excellent wines to the market at good prices, and supporting charitable causes at the same time. I like contributing to my own wine account and only ordering when I want, a refreshing change to the 'pushy' sales approach of other wine clubs. Thoroughly recommended.
NakedWines	GB	Great value for quality!	12 February 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	
NakedWines	GB	Pleased with Naked Wines	12 February 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Pleased with Naked Wines. They aren't pushy and allow you to choose when you want to order, offering a great selection, at less than supermarket prices, from exceptional independent growers. I subscribe a fixed amount which comes off the order price at the time of my order, so it's not like a club membership. No fees, just great wine.
NakedWines	GB	When is a scam not a scam?	12 February 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	When is a scam not a scam? I am unsure if the Naked Wines voucher I was given is a scam or not but it definitely isn’t what it seems.  The voucher says “Claim your £75 today” however it doesn’t say anywhere until you try to buy something that you have to spend almost £50 to get it. I went to their site to claim the voucher and thought I could buy some white wine. I went to the selection and discovered half the wines were not available to purchase unless you were one of their “Angels”. The only wines you could buy were the cheapest ones. Nevertheless I found a few I liked and went to the checkout. However my £75 voucher was not redeemable for wines of my own choice. I scanned the website and saw “Your Offer”. This is the only thing you can buy and use the voucher. It is 12 bottles of wine, mixed, red, white or luxury. You can’t chose the wines in each selection just take what they give you. If I had bought the 12 white wines the cost was £122.88 minus the voucher of £75.00. At the most generous you could say you were getting 12 bottles of wine for £3.99 but I wouldn’t pay £50 for 12 bottles of wine I may not have liked. For £50 I could have bought 3 or 4 I really wanted. I think this voucher is very misleading because it is not usable against anything you want to chose yourself. If they want to offer an incentive they would be best to say “12 bottles of wine of our choice for £50”. Many people would still be interested in this but many would not. As this voucher stands consumers are led to believe at Naked Wines you could use the voucher for £75 off any wine but that is not the case.
NakedWines	GB	Excellent choice of wines	12 February 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Excellent choice of wines to fit all budgets and super delivery being kept in touch the whole time.
NakedWines	GB	Brilliant company all round	12 February 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Such a brilliant company with a terrific ethos and great wines to boot!Highly recommended.
NakedWines	GB	A Wine Club for the Non-Connoisseur	12 February 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Over the years I have belonged to a few wine clubs, and to be frank I have not been disappointed with any. However, there are points of reference that separate them. Having been a member of Naked Wines for a couple of years now, I find the contributing payment method convenient, the unequivocal satisfaction guarantee reassuring, and the ability to interface with the winemakers, club membership and management, a nice touch.There is no risk attached to being a member and the rewards are unquenchenable! I recommend Naked Wines to anyone, especially those like me, who know what they like without being a connoisseur.
NakedWines	GB	The premise of Naked Wines seems to be…	12 February 2021	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	"The premise of Naked Wines seems to be ""don't spend £5 a bottle on supermarket wine - spend closer to £10 with our small producers"". I tried that with a number of different wines - some costing £12-£14 a bottle, others £8 a bottle. In my opinion, you are far wiser spending that much - but in a Supermarket. Go to pretty much any supermarket and spend £12 and you will pretty much get a far better wine than anything I tasted at Naked. Some of their wines seemed no better than £2 a bottle plonk at any French supermarket. The idea of spending more to get a better wine is good - but don't spend it at Naked."

NakedWines	GB	Support Independent Wine Producers	11 February 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Excellent selection of wines from around the world. Good quality at reasonable prices. Purchasing wine from Naked funds new and independent growers and producers and gives them scope to experiment and develop different varieties.
NakedWines	GB	Loyal customer now disappointed	11 February 2021	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	"Have been an ""Angel"" for several years and enjoy the product, however, the delivery solution has gone from bad to terrible...They use Yodel as the courier of choice (need I say any more?) I've had numerous ""missing"" cases of wine but the final straw has to be my latest order which I am told will take 8 days to deliver. The reason for this is apparently due to ""demand"" and ""adverse weather conditions"". I suggest you take a look at your competitors - I ordered recently from Virgin wines and received the case the following day - no excuses about weather or demand....This will probably be my last case of wine from Naked as I can get a better service elsewhere.**Updated 17/2/21**Despite the comment from Naked Wines to get in touch as stated below I have heard nothing... Also received an email today stating that my wine has been further delayed due to ""a problem at our warehouse"". I've given you the chance to respond to my issues and not only have I been ignored you've delayed my delivery even further. Beyond disappointed - I thought a ""premium wine club"" would provide a premium service but clearly not. Can I politely suggest that you look after your existing customers before bombarding the market with vouchers to attract new customers that you're clearly not geared up for?Goodbye Naked."

NakedWines	GB	If you enjoy tasting different wines you should try Naked Wines	10 February 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	We have been buying wines from Naked wines for a number of years now, always had fabulous service and even better wines.  When we got married 3 years ago we bought the wine for our wedding from Naked, who also helped us to choose the wines to go with our menu, excellent customer service and support.We continue to buy to support the smaller growers in the industry and to taste some of the not so well known wines, some of which have now become firm favourites with us.We have also been part of the ‘Angels’ initiative for a number of years which allows us the benefit of savings each time we order, a free bottle each month if we order a case and can be done for as little as £20 per month, it’s a great way to support the industry and savour the rewards too.

The wines are fantastic and can be tailored to suit your taste. You can either have wines recommended by the naked wine team or just choose your own case. You are absolutely under no obligation to buy wine every month, have it as and when you want it. Your money gets banked every month but is refunded if you decide to leave. I am not a big drinker, but I do like a nice glass of wine from time to time. Therefore I wait and let my wine account build up a little, then I make my selection. I cannot fault this amazing, interactive, fair and honest company. I love the work they do and I love being a naked wine angel. Go for it, give it a try, you really have nothing to lose. X

NakedWines	GB	First Purchase was a Gift	10 February 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I first purchased Naked Wines as a Father’s  Day gift for my husband when they had a fantastic offer for a case of wine.

I don’t miss the small amount I pay in per month but once I have enough saved it is lovely to purchase the new wines.
NakedWines	GB	An honest review of Naked Wines .	10 February 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I’ve been with Naked Wines for about six months now. All the wines selected have been mainly red wines as my preference, they have been among the best I’ve tasted in all my years of wine drinking. Although I’m no expert I know what I like and have been completely satisfied with the quality and performance of this company and products. I can’t wait to see what’s in store for the future. Thank you Naked Wines.

There are a lot of big name online wine stockists - trust me I’ve tried them all - but when you get an email from a wonderful South African wine maker thanking you for buying her produce that has allowed her to feed hungry school children, it just makes perfect sense and humbles you all at the same time. I’m proud to be an Angel and help support a company doing it the right way... the great wine is also a bonus! 😉

NakedWines	GB	HIGHLY RECOMMENDED	09 February 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I first used Naked Wines via an in mag/parcel coupon basically as it had a great discount and free delivery (why wouldn’t you?) with no push to continue. Really enjoyed the wines in the mixed starter case so ordered some more later down the line (don’t want to sound like I’ve a problem 🤪) with free delivery once again and an offer. Then I became an Angel (no, NOT because of the problem I HAVE NOT GOT! 🤔😂) Being an Angel means setting up a direct debit for an amount of MY choosing which goes to helping emerging winemakers AND saves up for future cases of wine AND, there are a lot of gifts available from these newbies, my Christmas 2020 case was fabulous! The guys at Naked Wines are friendly and informative via email (just right, not bombarded!) the service is great and I look forward to a hopefully long appreciative time with them 🤗 I don’t usually bother “reviewing” many things but think these guys deserve the recognition 👍

NakedWines	GB	What can I say	09 February 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	What can I say, it brilliant! Not received a bad bottle yet, delivery always on time, what I think is best, if you become an angel 👼 you contribute money monthly, for naked wines to help small struggling vineyards. In turn, you receive cheaper wine and all money contributed is always yours, so you give £20 per month and don't order for 2 months, you have £40 to come off your bill ! Win win all round 👍😁🍷

NakedWines	GB	I wasn't sure at first about Naked…	09 February 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I wasn't sure at first about Naked wines, the monthly contribution was a little disconcerting, probably due to the uncertain business climate at the moment, but it works so well. It allows you to build up a nice little kitty and splash out on either the more expensive wines, or just more wine, either works for me. The interaction with the growers is great, makes you feel part of something special. To top it off the wine selection is unusual and brilliant.

But when i enjoyed every single bottle of 12, i decided this was the club for me.I continue to sample different wines, but have to go back to my favourite first case.Soon i will be ordering another case, and look forward to sampling different wines.Red or white, the quality is outstanding.

A very enjoyable crisp wine which my wife Sue raved about from start to finish...well done Carmen your a star! Being mainly a red wine drinker I discovered the pleasure of Carlos Rodriquez Campo De Borja and enjoyed its really smooth delicious flavors with my blue Aberdeen Angus steak! Good stuff Carlos!Sue continues to enjoy her favorite wine, Arabella which she used to enjoy in South Africa when we lived there. He face always lights up when your case of wines is opened up and there’s the Arabella.We still have the fun of looking forward to tasting the rest of the wines we have stocked up with, which includes a number of naked wines we received in the Christmas hamper.Keep up the good work and all the very best....Nigel & Sue

I just order wine, don't get involved in rating feedback.The wines are excellent, in a variety of prices, easily comparable to supermarket offerings. It's great to try something different and also have favourites readily available. The occasional freebies are a great extra as they usually involve wines I wouldn't normally be able to afford. Worth giving them a go.Sue

Their wine selections are superb and have an amazing range of choice.As well as offering quality wines at affordable prices they regularly promote tempting incentives but without pressure. Further, free delivery on purchases over £100 to your door is again part of their generous and efficient service.Finally, they are genuinely interested in their members as they keep you informed of their wine growers community and new developments in the offing.
NakedWines	GB	Long time happy members.	09 February 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	We have been members of Naked Wines for approximately 5 years, and pay monthly, which entitles us to a discount on orders. During that time we have made numerous orders (when we have enough money in our account) and every time we have had access to a superb range of wines, from around the world, to try. Up to to now we have not been disappointed and have found a number of wines we enjoy, which we reorder along with new wines to sample. Ordering is simple online and delivery is prompt, and always on time. We are more than happy with our association with Naked Wines and look forward to many years of contented tippling in the knowledge we will never be disappointed .
NakedWines	GB	This is not a wine club it's a family.	09 February 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	We have been 'angels' for several years now so have been enjoying the benefits of such a great idea. All of the wines we have had in that time have been excellent, some have really become favourites and the clever people at Naked have even made it easy for us by remembering what we really like.Customer service really stands, out for example when I forgot to press the correct button and thought my order was lost they went out of their way to find it and give me what I wanted despite it being a special order.I think the whole concept of supporting independent wine growers is more relevant now when we need to make sure businesses survive this pandemic. Speaking of which, this is great time to try Naked and their wonderful wines.
NakedWines	GB	Wines that are different and very good.	09 February 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	We have had lovely and interesting wines and wonderful service from Naked wines.  Many of the wines are things we wouldn't necessarily have tried for ourselves so introduction to new winemakers is great.  We had a little difficulty with one order due to a misunderstanding but they were outstanding in putting it right. so I would highly recommend them.
NakedWines	GB	Brilliant Company. Cannot fault their wines.	09 February 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I have been a Naked Wines customer for many years and have never had a bad experience with them.  Their website is easy to navigate and the information on their wines is easy to understand, placing orders in so simple and you are kept updated at all stages.  The staff are really friendly on the rare occasions I have needed to contact them.  If you need advice on what wines you may like their expertise and knowledge is amazing.  If you choose a wine and don't like it they offer a no quibble money back guarantee.Their investment in small wine makers and vineyards means you are offered wines that are not mass produced or available in the shops so often get little gems that nobody else has heard of.

It's an amazing arrangement & a great way to support smaller vineyards producing fabulous wines without added costs from a middleman. I love that when a chosen wine isn't available an alternative is suggested & that notification is sent when it's back in stock. Contact during delivery is excellent.  Congratulations Team!

They send me details of wines similar to those I have liked in the past. Great value. Top quality. Great service. When I have run low and bought a bottle from a supermarket or off-licence I have always been disappointed as the quality for the price paid is never as good as those purchased as an Angel.

Their delivery is always prompt and I have never had a poor bottle of wine, many of which have been outstanding, they are always value for money.On two occasions, I've had cause to call, one for the delivery driver going to the wrong address, the other was a small mix up with the wines I had ordered. Both problems were immediately resolved, the support staff seem to care about the business, which is refreshing from an online ordering system.Highly recommended.
NakedWines	GB	Angels (members) of Naked Wines - We love it.	09 February 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Foreword: Just to say, we are not wine buffs. We taste it, we either like it or not. That's about the sum of our knowledge.We have been Angels (members) of Naked wines since December. We first used them to take advantage of the £70 voucher you sometimes find in magazines. The wines arrived quickly and we were really impressed with the quality of the wine. You then set up a monthly direct debit - the amount of your choosing (we save £20, but are probably going to increase this to £30), and that is placed in your Naked Wines account. When you come to order your wines the amount you have banked so far is clearly shown at the top of the app. The app is really easy to use and here you can rate each wine. We only disliked one wine and upon adding feedback we received an offer of a refund, which we didn't take as we know our money goes towards helping small and new winemakers. Once you've placed your feedback, you then receive a reply direct from the winemaker to your comments. If you rate a wine highly, the app will ask if you would like 6 bottles put aside the next time the wine is available. Once the wine is available Naked Wines will send you a message before the wines are despatched to check you still want them, that way you don't get any surprises. We have taken advantage of this offer, although the wine has not become available yet.You occasionally get offered a free bottle of wine with your next order, or sometimes you received a £10 credit for being a member.The app builds a profile about your tastes by asking you questions, and then makes recommendations that you might like.A side note: This week - Feb 21, my husband and I took part in an online wine tasting Zoom session (not a Naked Wines thing - bear with me). The wines were dropped off to our door, then a very knowledgeable person took us through the wines etc. What we took away from the experience is that in comparison to other wines that come direct from wine makers, or that you would buy in a wine shop, we really do get quite a heavy discount off the wines at Naked Wines.In summary: we are proud to be part of Naked Wines, and look forward to each new bottle we try.

NakedWines	GB	Wines and concept are brilliant	09 February 2021	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	Wines and concept are brilliant. Customer service is great, prompt, polite and helpful. BUT - I have had several consecutive orders with items missing. The first couple of times I was compensated (completely voluntarily by NW) but last time I wasn't. The missing item was credited but now I'm left with the uncomfortable feeling that I've been marked up as someone 'pulling a fast one'. I think there must be a warehouse problem which is a shame as this has now resulted in my being reluctant to order. I don't want to feel like a criminal if I have to point out that my order is short again. I must stress, nobody has accused me, just the difference in the way I the situation was handled on the last occasion. Please sort this out NW as the rest of your business is fab.

NakedWines	GB	Naked Wines	08 February 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	"I have been a Naked Wines ""Angel"" for some years now, paying a regular sum of my choice into my account and supporting independent winemakers in the process. NW communicate regularly about new wine makers, new wines and special offers. At times, I have asked their advisers to make selections for me and they have never let me down. But very often, I like to spend time on the site, compiling the basket myself. In all cases, ordering has been a breeze and the service has always been excellent.

As a company that also invests in small and emerging wine makers it is good to know our purchases are supporting them.

NakedWines	GB	I would recommend Naked Wines to anyone…	08 February 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I would recommend Naked Wines to anyone who is interested in sustainable,  ethical business.  We have been with them for over 10 years. Always helpful, efficient  and friendly.  And with great wines, what's not to love?
NakedWines	GB	Naked Wines an outstanding concept	08 February 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I can’t rate Naked Wines highly enough. Not only are the wines excellent but the principal concept of Naked Angels supporting up-and-coming and established wine makers with much needed funding through monthly account savings is truly commendable and results in some fantastic wines. Supporting academic bursaries and inspiring charitable initiatives is the icing on the cake. I’m really glad I became an Angel so many years ago.
NakedWines	GB	Sunshine and Individuality in a Bottle.	08 February 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	This is such a great idea for people who love wine and what a way to buy fabulous wine. I pay a regular amount into my wine account and NW use this money to help the people who grow the vines and make the stuff we drink. This makes life so much easier and predictable for the growers etc. Wines with individuality are then made for a guaranteed market which I (and lots of others Angels) can drink. The idea is so good. Lots of individuals have been helped and the rewards........lots of individual wines. If you drink wine, other than visiting the vineyards yourself (I do that as well) it’s a really personable way of buying sunshine in a bottle.
NakedWines	GB	Over 10 years in - still loving Naked WInes!	08 February 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Been a customer pretty much since the start, and I've loved being part of the journey.  Have got to meet some of the team over the years, and they really care about their customers and their wine-makers.  In over 10 years I've only ever had one hiccup with any of my orders, and that was rectified quickly and easily and I got sent a bottle of wine as an apology too.  Customer service done right, products done right and overall just a great little company to get wine from.  Of course it goes without saying that the wine has been absolutely first-rate over the years, and the ability to get sent the new vintage of your favourites automatically makes for a very pleasant surprise (especially when you forget you signed up for it and don't read your e-mail!).  Just all round good news.  Try it if you haven't, you will not be disappointed!

NakedWines	GB	Not really a review	08 February 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Not really a review, I was on the verge of making an order, whilst it would appear, from various reviews,your wines are between, at best great and at worst not so great. That said I was going to have a punt, then I read who you use as a delivery company, Yodel, put me right off, especially as it would appear you continue to use them, despite having to replace numerous missing deliveries, begs question where are the original deliveries going? !!! this can't be doing your bottom line a  power of good, get a different delivery firm I might be tempted.

NakedWines	GB	I've been a Naked supported for many years	08 February 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I've been with Naked Wines now almost since they set up and am completely happy with my 'membership'. I became an 'Angel' early on and even invested in their Fine Wines when this was set up, which over the three years I committed to, gave a far better return than anything I had invested in before or after. The support for small independent wine makers is essential and the wines, from all over the world, are often exceptional. I usually allow my monthly contribution to add up for three or four months so I can buy a case with minimal additional spend. The delivery is always when they say and in normal circumstances, ie not under COVID 19 lockdown conditions, it is really fast delivery, often within a day or two of ordering. Thumbs up all round!

NakedWines	GB	Spotify radio of the wine trade	08 February 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Naked Wines is the Spotify radio of the wine trade. I buy one wine and they recommend others I might like. I have discovered so many wines that I would never have touched with a bargepole had Naked not persuaded me. And I mean winemakers who are making world class wines through their raw winemaking talent and dedication. Their customer service is excellent and simple. If you don't like a wine don't pay for it. By virtue of the huge volumes of wine that they now sell and the enthusiasts who review the wines you can draw a pretty good conclusion as to whether a wine is for you. You will learn to find certain producers who cannot make a bad wine. I swear, if you gave Katie Jones some gravel and baked beans she would make a stunningly polished, elegant fruity wine.
NakedWines	GB	Excellent wines and service	08 February 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Although there is not a massive selection of wines, everything I have ordered has been excellent, at least an 8/10 rating.Prices are very reasonable and delivery is excellent.

For the first time recently I bought a bottle of gin which was a special offer at 50%. It was dreadful to my palate. I gave it a one star review and next thing I received an email expressing regret and confirming I would receive a credit for the FULL price!

NakedWines	GB	Great wine with integrity	08 February 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I enjoy wine, but am a long way short of being a connoisseur. I've tried a few different wine subscription programs over the years without being filled with any great sense of value or loyalty. However, I have been entirely impressed with Naked Wines. I did deliberate over whether I wanted to get involved in the subscription style model, but it's proven to work just fine for me. The app has really helped me define what sort of wines I prefer, without falling into the trap of always defaulting to the same style. There is great community to tap into too if you want to. Beyond that, I love that you can connect directly with the winemakers - they are real people and they are very accessible. I genuinely feel that I am investing in their passion and then getting to drink the benefit - couldn't be happier.

NakedWines	GB	The best on-line wine merchant we've ever tried	07 February 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I've tried a few online wine merchants, and while most of them are good, Naked Wines are great! From the great introductions to wines and wine-makers, to great values boxes, and now to the impressive commitment to responsible business and supporting wine makers from non-white backgrounds - its a win:win all round.

Nothing to lose, everything to gain, and even better we love hearing about how we are helping small vineyards to continue in such difficult times.

I saw six bottles white I really liked and clicked to have £10 deposit taken.  Told the wine would be delivered when it came from abroad.  I saw another six in similar circumstances and waited to hear it was in and I could pay the rest from my account.  Nothing happened so went on the account and saw nothing in my account where there should have been deposits.  I set up a discussion resulting in my account being credited with my monthly deposit but nothing about the amounts activated and saw instead to delete the order as no stock left, or words to that effect.Lost total interest then.  Joined Virgin, getting on great with my Virgin 'James' just bit of a shock to have both my wine people with same Christian name!  I have not stopped my deposit and will look to purchasing another case.  Sorry not the review I would like to have given. I was so disappointed I did not understand when you click and get told you are successful, in the end you don't get the money into the account nor do you get the wine you really watched so you could get a decent deal.  Could have been something I did wrong, but that is how it worked for me.

NakedWines	IT	DON'T!!	06 February 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I have to admit I was a bit lost here in UK (I'm from Italy) since quality of wines you can find is shops is really not what I was used to, having had an entire life of quality, tasty, genuine wines.I tried other online services, but only Naked Wines provides this level of excellent quality and genuine tasting experience, not even mentioning the vibrant community or their ethical (and practical) stance on wine production.So DON'T!Just DON'T subscribe to Naked Wines, or you'll risk addiction to the incredible quality of their wines!You're not going to be able to drink wine coming from other sources anymore!You have been warned.
NakedWines	GB	Naked wines sent a voucher to me!!!!	06 February 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	"Naked wines sent a voucher to me for £75. When you visit the website unless you are an enrolled ""angel"" the choice of wines is farcical. The choices you have are limited to frankly over priced to ludicrously priced wines. So I will stick to The Wine Society a truly honourable wine merchant."

The service is brilliant with orders arriving very quickly by very friendly drivers.Also the Christmas boxes are lovely with all sorts of goodies on top of the wines.

NakedWines	GB	Great wines and service	06 February 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	"The wines are fantastic and the app is really useful for discovering new wines as it works out your preferences. Even the ones that weren't to our taste were still better than supermarket favourites. If I'm honest, I probably spend far more per bottle than I used to, but the wine is far better quality for the price, that said there are loads of cheaper bottles which would rival any mainstream brand and we could never go back. The courier ""dropped"" the order twice but NW were all over it and sorted in a day or two."

If you enjoy good quality wine you will find it hard to find the same quality wine for the same price in the supermarkets. Obviously I haven’t enjoyed every wine sent but on the rare occasion I’ve had an issue customer services have offered a satisfactory solution without a quibble. The ability to purchase wine when I feel like it (rather than obliged to order during a set period) is also a plus. Thoroughly recommended

However, what is different this time is that I have remained a Naked Wines ‘Angel’ for almost a year now, and will continue to do so based on the exceptional quality of the wine I have purchased. I can of course buy wine cheaper elsewhere, but I can honestly say I have rarely found the same depth of quality. I am being introduced to superb wine producers and wines I have not experienced before. I have enjoyed EVERY bottle... It is an amazing journey so far, and I look forward to it continuing.

NakedWines	GB	Fabulously heart warming.	05 February 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	"This is a fabulous, warm hearted organisation that finds and sponsors independent and talented winemakers around the world and sells the results at discount prices to their ""Angels""(members). The wines are wonderful and special - never had even a mediocre one in all the years I've been an Angel. They even raise money for an undeniably worthy cause started by one of their winemakers. You can get involved in the winemakers' stories, communicate directly with them, record your tasting notes and read others' OR you can just pay an amount per month and when your account is ready, order a case of wine that's swiftly delivered to you door. All of it is pain free and joyous. Warmly recommended !"

We selected the 6 and we enjoyed each one of them, in fact we have re ordered one of them 3 times now, it’s that good!We became angels, this means that we loan £20 a month to Naked Wines who in turn loan it to up and coming winemakers to help them develop their businesses. When we have accrued £40 we place an order for 12 bottles of wine.The cost of this wine is reduced by the £40 that we had loaned to Naked Wines. The wine is delivered to the door, usually with in a couple of days of placing the order, by Yodel, The whole process works very well and we get great wines to drink when we want via a great delivery service.

I've pretty much ordered a monthly case since. They have introduced me to new wines I'd never usually think of trying. When I go through the choices now it makes my mouth water and I now drink wine with more consideration and love the fact that I can support small Vineyards and Producers to make such excellent wines for us. I love that when I review a wine, I get a response directly from the Producer. I'm learning about wine and what I like and don't and I no longer simply quaff wine for the sake of it. Quality is everything.

NakedWines	GB	Wines.	05 February 2021	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	"I have been buying wines from Naked for quite  a few years now and never had bottle I didn't like. I also like the idea of supporting smaller vineyards and ""meeting"" the people behind the wines.I like the idea of putting away a sum of money each month so when I need more wine the money is there waiting. That's important to me!This last year because of covid 19  everything has had to be done on line - I much prefer making a telephone call, discussing the wines and selecting my case of wine as I want it..... so hopefully one day soon we can return to this method.Thank you.Mary."

NakedWines	GB	Great wines from a brilliant company.	05 February 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I signed up to Naked Wines a few years ago and have had hundreds of wines from them, almost all of which I loved and the ones I didn't were simply because they were not to my taste.  I have attended two wine tastings, which are huge fun and great to meet the people who make the wine.  Naked Wines' customer service is excellent.  I have only had a problem with my delivery once and it was resolved swiftly and entirely to my satisfaction.  They are fun and friendly and knowing that we are helping independent winemakers is a great feeling.

NakedWines	GB	Such a lovely Wine family to be in	05 February 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Such a lovely Wine family to be in. I have never had a bad wine from Naked Wines. I have found wines that I buy over and over again and enjoy trying new wines recommended and reviewed by other Wine Angels. I have been with Naked Wines for 2 years and cannot imagine ever not being.
NakedWines	GB	I love Naked Wines..	05 February 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I love Naked Wines... the selection is wide and the quality reliable. The biggest treat last year was the special Christmas collection which was excellent value ... I will certainly be ordering this again. I have never had to complain about a bottle, but am sure that if I did, my comments would be dealt with seriously. I like the whole concept and find the winemakers’ comments informative and interesting..
NakedWines	GB	Fabulous wines at remarkably low prices.	05 February 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	When I first saw an advert for Naked wines I thought it sounded too good to be true and that there must be a catch. I was mistaken! The introduction offer was wonderful - 6 really good wines delivered to my door for under £30 but since taking that off up last July I have re-ordered a couple of other 12 bottle cases which have also been excellent and at an exceptionally good price. And as if that's not great enough there is always a a free bottle or two of something wonderful and unexpected. The delivery process is easy and efficient too.
NakedWines	GB	I have thoroughly enjoyed every bottle…	05 February 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I have thoroughly enjoyed every bottle I have had from Naked Wines, so much so I recommended them to  my daughter.  Plus you don't automatically get another box without ordering one.  I find the fact that I pay monthly makes me feel good when I do order as I don't pay the full price in a lump.
NakedWines	GB	Amazing wine	05 February 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Naked wines not only do the most amazing wine, better than anything you can buy in the shops. The customer service is brilliant very helpful and resolves any problems. They help you to pick wine to suit your tastes and have all the information you need to make a great choice.
NakedWines	GB	I enjoy a glass ( or two) of red wine…	05 February 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I enjoy a glass ( or two) of red wine and usually buy what's on offer at the supermarket. However I was tempted during lockdown to sign up to Naked wines. I saw an ad and read about the ethos of their business and took advantage of their half price deal for a case of red. All I can say is every bottle was delicious and you can tell the difference between them and the budget wines I usually drink. I was a bit dubious at first when signing up to give a monthly direct debit payment, however I am quite happy to use this to save up and use to buy a case when I have enough saved up. I love Naked Wines, and savour every drop!

NakedWines	GB	8 years with Naked Wines	05 February 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I’ve been an “Angel” with Naked Wines for over 8 years so it probably goes without saying that I’ve been really pleased with the experience. The concept of being an “Angel” and the way that Naked Wines works is unique I believe and rather than describe it here it is probably better for anyone interested to view their website. There is a great range of wines, the customer service is really good and the quality of the wines has been excellent in my view. I did have one wine I didn’t enjoy and Naked, true to their word, refunded the cost immediately.Naked also have some extra curricular activities, for example  Zoom sessions with some of the wine growers and charity activities to fund lunches for school kids in South Africa. So to sum up, I’m glad I joined the Angels and look forward to many years remaining a member in the future.

I like that my wine is delivered to me and I don't have to carry it back from the shops. However the most important this is their wine. Firstly, I feel it is much better than supermarket wines and I'm not having to pay way over the odds for a decent bottle. Out of all the bottles I have drank so far I have never had a ""bad"" one. I have really enjoyed sampling what Naked Wines have to offer."

NakedWines	GB	Naked Wines, Dressed accordingly!	05 February 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I find Naked Wines a great website, very clear and concise. I stumbled across Naked Wines by accident and they had a great introductory offer. The wines, obviously won't be to everyone's tastes, but Naked Wines try and assist you in your purchases and they help with decision making. Anything I have had so far has been really great wine, in fact I was rarely a white wine drinker until I started buying from them, now, some of their whites are great, not sharp, vinegary or full of aftertaste. I would recommend Naked Wines to anyone.
NakedWines	GB	Great Wines!	05 February 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Really great wines, great value for money.
NakedWines	GB	Naked wines is unique and special	05 February 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I joined Naked Wines quite a few years ago and there are several things I love about it. First of all you put in a monthly sum which builds up towards what you buy which is brilliant because it cuts the cost of your total purchase when it comes. Or so it seems to a forgetful person like me😄 Secondly you get introduced to amazing wines that you might otherwise not have tried! I have had some wonderful Chardonnays, Riojas and Cabernet Sauvignons to name but a few. The prices are slightly more than I was paying before but still cheaper than the market price and wonderful quality. Also being part of Naked Wines, every so often you get a freebie thrown in which is a real treat, I once got a Magnum of one of my favourites 😄. Naked Wines is like a family. You get to know the growers and the people who contact you. You can chat to other folk if you want. It is unique and special and I would recommend it 💖
NakedWines	GB	Excellent	05 February 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Excellent service, good value for money and great tasting wines 👍
NakedWines	GB	No better wine business	05 February 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	The wines on offer are terrific as well as have a really broad ranges of wines, including fortified and dessert but also including gin. Their special boxes are great value and they are super easy to work with. Much better and more personal than other “wine clubs.”
NakedWines	GB	Naked Wines - Thumbs up from me	05 February 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I saw an ad on Facebook and thought we would give it a go, just before christmas so the idea of having wines we wouldnt normally get to hear about sounded good, I think its same to say of the 6 bottles we were not disappointed, each of them having their own individual characteristics, both me and my wife loved them, definitely looking forward to the next box

NakedWines	GB	The wines are exceptional	05 February 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	The wines are exceptional and are from smaller wine growers, some more established than others.

NakedWines	GB	It’s all about great wine	05 February 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Having tried a number of wine clubs in the past I was quite sceptical but I can honestly say Naked has been a breath of fresh air. So far all of the wines have been a step up in the quality I expected for the prices and there have been a fair share of gems. You are able to communicate with the growers for advice and recommendations which takes you to a whole new experience in wine selection. If you care about the wine you buy and who actually makes it the I can’t recommend naked highly enough.
NakedWines	GB	I love the philosophy of Naked	05 February 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I love the philosophy of Naked, investing in independent wine growers and nothing on offer from the big corporates. I don't think I've ever ordered wine from here that I did not like. Great set up and great wine.

NakedWines	GB	Very simple - Better wine	05 February 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Very simple, the wine is far superior quality than the vast majority of wines you buy in the supermarket. I have been with them for over 6years and their customer service is second to none. Don’t like a wine - refund. No questions asked! If you have a voucher, give it a try. If you don’t like the wine - cancel. I have referred over 10 people, all of who and now subscribers! Enjoy!!

NakedWines	GB	Generally very good	05 February 2021	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	Generally very good.  last delivery of 15 bottles contained the wrong wine (second time its happened) where a red italian wine appeared in place of a white chardonnay !! leaving me with having to do a visit to a supermarket to ensure that the 'boss' can have her fill of white wine. I know Jesus turned water into wine but could he change white to red?  The time between ordering and delivery has extended out from 1-2 days and is now 7-8 days with the latest delivery being a day later than initially indicated.  Thats all fine if you plan more in advance though.  Hope this is just a hiccup.wines are good though.

NakedWines	GB	Love Naked Wines	05 February 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Love Naked Wines. The standing order mounts up quickly and when I contribute to my order tend to buy more select wine than my pension would normally command. The selection of small growers has allowed a big jump in the variety and taste of wines I drink. Too much commercial wine,in the range I can afford,is same old same old!Like the ethos of supporting small growers
NakedWines	GB	Naked Wines	04 February 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I’ve been a Naked Wines Angel for a number of years now and always been pleased with the wine and service I’ve received. All the wines are described in full to give you a good idea of what they will taste like, but if you should buy a wine and you are not happy, Naked Wines will replace or refund the cost of the wine.

Being an Angel gives you access to advice if you want it and forums to join in with other wine enthusiasts as well as invitations to online tastings in which you can ask questions meet the winemakers or Receive invitations to wine events ( though due to Covid these are not happening at this time for safety reasons).

NakedWines	GB	Couldn’t recommend it highly enough.	04 February 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I have been with Naked Wines for a number of years - I have referred people to them as they are a brilliant team. Their customer service is faultless, their ethos is bang on the money. You choose your own wine as and when you want it - it doesn’t feel like you are spending money as a direct debit comes out of your account on payday and sits in your wine fund until you are ready to order.Rate your wine - if it’s not right they refund.I know my wine fund is being used for funding excellent independent wine makers across the world and doing good where it is most needed. I’m thanked in quality free wine too! What’s not to love? P.S. The wine is top class - some of it award winning.

NakedWines	GB	More than just wine sales	04 February 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Wines are clearly rated with the percentage of buyers who would buy that wine again and I have yet to find one we have not liked. Once you have placed a few orders and rated those wines Naked then indicate on your page which they consider you will like most. Again I have not ordered one we have not liked. What you contribute monthly can be increased, you are not tied down to order on a regular basis and if you need extra for a special event you just pay the outstanding amount that month. You are made to feel like more like a club member than a customer.

NakedWines	GB	Appropriate praise for a top company.	04 February 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I’ve been with Naked Wines only a short time but found everything about their promotion to be spot on. The company are friendly, informative, great natured and clearly care about the wines they promote. I have always been focused on French wine as I have family there, both in Bordeaux and Burgundy, gaining knowledge in both, but since joining, I have tried many wines from areas I would never have considered and am yet to open a bad one. The diversity in geography and grape have made this a rewarding experience that I control with a reasonable budget. I congratulate them on their choices and look forward to opening each case to see what’s new to me. The Christmas Case was a joy and contained a generous selection of freebies that as a new customer I enjoyed immensely.
NakedWines	GB	Great value delicious wine	04 February 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Great value delicious wine, with excellent customer service and support.

NakedWines	GB	Good company	04 February 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Good company, research wines and people involved and are committed to help whenever possible through their Angels programme with the help and assistance of their customers. They have the commitment to put right any faulty/damaged item without quibble quickly and without fuss. I am glad that I joined this company for my wine supply. My only comment on negatives is that their courier does not always advise he is at your door and just leaves goods in unsecure manner in my instance,despite complaint to both supplier and courier. If you don’t track your delivery on the day watch out.

NakedWines	GB	I love Naked Wines	04 February 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I joined Naked Wines in Feb 2020 using one of their offers. By the time I was ready to order my first case the Covid-19 pandemic restrictions had kicked in and the choice was limited to a few cases. I chose a box of reds, thinking I may not like a lot of them as my previous supermarket selections had been reduced to either Malbec or Rioja. Much to my surprise I found that when the quality is there I can enjoy a much larger range of red wine than before. I have discovered many other varieties I had never tried before and was very happy to try new mixed cases over the following months. I now have a much better idea of what I like and am happy to say that, although I still stick to red wine, I like many varieties and enjoy trying new ones each month. Thank you Naked Wines. Oh, and by the way, if you do need to contact customer services for anything you couldn't wish for a more helpful, lovely group of people.

NakedWines	GB	I’ve always been sceptical of “wine…	04 February 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I’ve always been sceptical of “wine clubs”, assuming they aren’t good value once the initial offer is taken up. Naked Wines are brilliant. There’s no pressure to buy. The wines are fantastic, so much so that I usually get their mixed cases knowing I’ll enjoy them all, rather than choosing my own selection from ones I’ve had and enjoyed, such is the consistent quality. Paying in a small monthly fee to become an “Angel” is well worth it. Not only do you get discounts and freebies, the money just comes off whenever you place an order (so all you’re doing is putting aside a little each month, it is always my money). And you can opt out anytime.Lots of information on the wines and winemakers is available, with some great stories.And finally, the freebies are excellent, quality stuff. I’m a very happy customer and thoroughly recommend them.

The support given to smaller vineyards to help grow their business is great. You occasionally get one too many emails from them, but the best way to order your wines is wait for the special email once a month which includes a free premium bottle or sometimes a free magnum. Worth waiting for that.

NakedWines	GB	Champion of champions in the wine world…	04 February 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Champion of champions in the wine world !I cannot fault Naked Wines in anyway, Ethos is just the best, they really do care for the wine maker, the environment and of course the customer is always king. They really know their wines and being an 'Angel' knowing you are helping your wine maker create the best wine they can for you, just makes me smile. We get to interact with like minded people and talk with our wine makers (they are a very human, passionate bunch) the Naked Service team, just rock and will help you with anything you need from recommendations to keeping you posted on your order. I really cant recommend this company more, if you like quality wine at an amazing price and want to learn more about wine and join a fun group of passionate people, or you care about the wine maker and the environment,  or just want to drink nice wine, then these are the wine guys / girls for you.

Delivery is prompt and there is usually a little something extra in each parcel which is such a bonus.  Its great to know you are supporting smaller independent winemakers plus sampling wines you don't find on the supermarket shelf.

NakedWines	GB	I'm a lifelong wine lover	04 February 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I'm a lifelong wine lover, so started using Naked a couple of years ago. I've really enjoyed the experience: choosing wine from home, reading the descriptions and ordering. All my orders have arrived on the right day, apart from once when it was clear a bottle had broken, so it was a day or two later. I got a credit for a bottle on my next order, as well as the replacement. I enjoy the range of wines and the email content too. I've recruited my brother in law to the cause, and suggested to some friends. Great service, tasty wine.

NakedWines	GB	My favourite wine club	04 February 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	My favourite wine club. They market themselves based on the difference between their wines and supermarket wines. I was sceptical at first that there could be that much difference but I was wrong. Yes, you're not paying £5.00 a bottle but the wine which averages out around £8.00 to £10.00 depending on what you buy obviously is completely different class. I will never go back to supermarket wine. There is a massive choice of wines to choose from whether you like red, white, rose, sparkling etc. Excellent delivery service and an abundance of information and reviews from other members to help you make an informed choice. I personally like the way you build up a balance in your angels account that you use whenever you want against your purchases. Also, if you really dislike a bottle you can contact them for a full refund. I haven't had to make use of this facility as yet however. I have tried a couple of other wine clubs but Naked is a firm favourite for me and the only one I currently buy from.

They are good quality and really easy to order, I’ve not had a bad wine yet! Beats supermarket wine any day!

NakedWines	GB	Become an Angel! (Even if it's just for the amazing Christmas Box!)	04 February 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I've been a Naked Wines 'Angel' since 2014 and have really enjoyed being part of it all - I've also managed to get a few friends and family members on board. I fully approve of the Naked Wines ethos and the support and opportunities they provide to wineries big and small, perhaps allowing a shall winery to get off the ground, or a bigger one to experiment with something new. I really like the fact that it isn't a wine subscription so you can buy as much or as little as you like, safe in the knowledge that the money in your 'wine piggy bank' will be invested wisely on your behalf (as an Angel, you often have a direct say in where the money is invested). Personally, I'm not a big user of social media but if you want to get really involved in the wines and talk to the producers directly, then the various forums and discussion boards will scratch that itch! To be perfectly honest, it is 100% worth becoming an Angel even if you just get the amazing Christmas Box each year! Throughout the year, there are some great freebies, as well as interesting 'one-offs' (e.g. whisky, gin, port, etc). If you ARE going to join, ask your friends for a referral, or hunt around in magazines and newspapers for a good discount on your first box - you won't be disappointed!
NakedWines	GB	Good wine	04 February 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Good wine, full of flavour, from Independent growers. Great communication with the suppliers, matched by a fast delivery service.

NakedWines	GB	Love Naked Wines	04 February 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Love Naked Wines! Good value. Savings scheme means cash balance quickly builds up in my account, which I can then use to buy delicious wines. Free bottles regularly on offer, subject to purchasing a box of wines. Christmas boxes also excellent value and, most importantly, extremely tasty! Highly recommended.
NakedWines	GB	Brilliant concept and fabulous wines	04 February 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Brilliant concept and fabulous wines. The wine is far better quality than the average supermarket selection and is very well priced too - lots of options from well below £10. The concept goes beyond the typical wine delivery where a pre mixed case arrives every month/quarter. You only have to take a case of wine when you need (well - want!) one and can pick freely from a wide range or go for a pre mixed case. There is plenty of information on the wines and the winemakers as well as online tastings, then an app where you can keep track of your favourites for re-purchase and suggestions of others you might enjoy based on your tasting profile.  Naked funds winemakers to explore making new wines and supports various good causes too - a real feel good company to buy from.

NakedWines	GB	Disapponting & Poor Customer Service	03 February 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	Only joined Naked Wines in Oct/Nov 2020...our first 2 cases did have 1 or 2 substitutions each but that is something that can happen but our 3rd case received a week ago was a mess. From the list of wines on the website that should have been in the case 4 were substituted and from the packing list that came with the case the substitutions were also then substituted (in the end we were not sure what was substituting what!) and strangely all the wines were still showing as available on the website. In the end we received 3 of the same wine and 1 wine that we had already rated that we would not buy again. Having to wait quite a few days from ordering to receiving the case and then so many errors is not acceptable.Speaking to customer services (in the end 3 different people) at the start it was they would get it sorted then towards the end it was if they collect the wrong wines they will send out the correct wines. The correct ones should have been sent in the first place. Of course as this had not been mentioned at the start we had tried some of the wines and now that we did not have all of the 4 wrong wines they could not do anything. We were told that there had been packing errors and in the warehouse when packing that it is done by numbers and not the actual wine names (and obviously they do not look at what you have rated before either).In the end we felt that Naked Wines were almost making it that it was our fault or that we were trying to be sneaky. We decided to cancel our Angel account...but it turns out this leaves you with a basic account that you cannot delete and you are also unable to remove your payment card from the system. We emailed about this and Naked Wines advised that they are going to refund us for the 4 wrong bottles which is great but they have still lost customers who would have been happy to stay if this had been handled differently. We again requested for all our details to be deleted or at least delete the payment card off system, however, the data protection team contacted us to advise that due to English Contract Law that they have to keep details from our last financial transaction for 7 years then it will be deleted but our card details will be inaccessible to their staff but the details are still on there...you should be able to delete at the least the card details this does not affect past orders or transactions.Had heard that Naked Wines customer services were great but unfortunately that is not our experience...maybe they now have so many customers they can lose a few and not worry about it.

I've been with Naked Wines around a year now and never had a bad bottle. You get quiet a few e-mails from them offering deals and forums to meet the growers and maker. There is no hard sell I just order when I am looking low in my wine rack and delivery arrives within 2 or 3 days.{ unless there is an offer you can not resist like at xmas )

The customer engagement is a breath of fresh air and I love that the wines come from independent vineyards - I've not had a bad bottle yet! The little surprises (like a free bottle popped into your shopping cart) is an added bonus. I now have a small investment plan with Naked to make it easier to purchase a quarterly case of wine. So impressed and can highly recommend this company.
NakedWines	GB	Questionable ethics when secret subscription is so hard to detect	02 February 2021	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	As a TOTUM card member I was excited to see a code for £30 off my first case purchased through Naked wine. Knowing this is an organisation which also deals with subscription I approached this extremely carefully, reading every detail about what my voucher was giving me. I even trawled through every word of the T&Cs which contained very ambiguous wording.Satisfied that I couldn’t see anything at all that clearly suggested I was signing up to anything, I went ahead. I then read lots of posts online about how others had been unknowingly trapped into subscriptions, and I smugly shook my head wondering why these people didn’t trawl through the small print to check these things, like I did.As an extra precaution, when the order went through I emailed the company to triple check I wasn’t now part of some kind of scheme. Alas, the response came back to say that I was - in fact rather patronisingly apologetic that I hadn’t seen the parts of the process which apparently made it all very clear indeed. I’m a fairly well educated individual and if you imagine also someone who checks T&Cs (I’m a hoot) I can assure you- it wasn’t.I have now requested this is ended immediately and no subscription payment be taken from my account, however can’t help but reflect on how companies (particularly this one whose USP seems to be ethics) can get away with this. Surely it’s a given that putting a customer into any kind of subscription scheme should be made absolutely, abundantly clear from the offset.Disappointing, Naked wines.
NakedWines	GB	Absolutely brilliant company	02 February 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Absolutely brilliant company. Pay a small amount into your account on a monthly basis and receive a cracking case of wine delivered to your door. Wines are easy to choose and I’ve never had a dud one.

NakedWines	GB	A fall from heaven; was great now poor.  Avoid, allow them to settle and return later possibly.	02 February 2021	Rated 2 out of 5 stars	The service used to be first-rate.  However, leading into this Christmas, this went seriously awry. Long term customers didn't receive a much anticipated and advertised email prompting them to order their Christmas box meaning many lost out.  I was fortunate that other forumites highlighted the issue whereupon I discovered that a search of Google was allowing customers new and old alike to order the much-coveted Christmas case.  Many customers however had been told they would be sent an email promoting them to order BEFORE it went on general sale.  The customer support was absent to the point they haven't acknowledged the issue yet.  The failure was apparently customers who deign to use Hotmail.This issue has since reared its head for me with payment being taken from my account for a case pre-ordered some months before.  No reminder email received.  I was alerted to it by my banking fraud protection service.  Granted that I could/should have remembered the order but on speaking to Customer Services it was again my fault for not checking my emails.  Which I do.This indicated there has been zero learning from the debacle that was Christmas (you are welcome to review their own forum pages for wider confirmation of the issue and handling thereof).The Christmas box was also somewhat of a disappointment.  For example, the c£60 of bundled 'free' goodies included a £40 hand wash and hand lotion set?  Pretty sure that isn't what I go to a wine supplier for.  Even if the irony in the year wasn't lost on many.In sum, the customer service was the draw - it's simply not there.  Left very much to feel as if it's your fault by customer services.The recent departure of a founder is potentially a sign of turbulence or disquiet.
NakedWines	GB	Beyond	02 February 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	We first experienced Naked Wines through a friend of mine who brought them to us weekly.

NakedWines	GB	Long term member of Naked Wines	02 February 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I have been a member of Naked Wines for many years and always found then very professional. They also sell very good wine which is frequently not available elsewhere! Naked offer this in return for a monthly payment which they use to support small winemakers who give members a big discount on the wine. It's a Win-Win all round and we have our favourites in South Africa, California, Argentina and Australia to name a few. We are so pleased we have introduced several of our friends.Further thoughts, it's not a wine club so you don't have to accept a case every month. It's very flexible and Naked will recommend wines but you do don't have to accept them, we chose our own. If there's not enough money in your kitty, you can pay any extra as it's best to buy a reasonable amount at a time and then you can get free delivery. You even get an occasional free bottle! What's not to like?

I like the tone of their interaction with customers, I like the level at which they interact with their suppliers (the winemakers) and the ethos of the company. I also have absolutely no complaints to make about the customer service. On the one occasion I had a complaint, they dealt with it quickly, simply and generously. The business model is also perfect for the service they offer. Fully deserving of those five stars.
NakedWines	GB	Excellent Service - Naked Wines	02 February 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Naked Wines have been first class in all aspects of their service, very professional, courteous and always try to make the delivery date when stated.

NakedWines	GB	A friend recommended Naked Wines to me…	02 February 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	A friend recommended Naked Wines to me and I’ve never looked back. You get to experience wines that you don’t see in the supermarket and at the same time helping small, or new winegrowers. I have never been pressurised to buy wines or having packages delivered that I haven’t ordered.  You buy wines as and when you want and you are not bombarded with emails on a daily basis as some companies tend to do.All round good experience
NakedWines	GB	The Naked  Truth........	02 February 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I have been  member of naked wines for three years and bought many cases of wine, mainly red, and can honestly say that I, and the friends that I have shared a bottle or two with, have not had one that we haven't enjoyed. They bring you wine lesser from lesser known vineyards but all of good quality and value.

The opportunity to try wines you won’t find anywhere else and the rock solid guarantee that they’ll always make good if there’s a wine you don’t like are winners for me.Even better, a few quid a month off the credit card is something you hardly notice after a while and all of a sudden, you’ve paid for another case of loveliness.Highly recommended.

Their range of wines, the quality and the pricing structure is second to none, and their customer service is of the highest standard.And the thought that you are helping to develop independent winemakers all over the world gives you almost a bigger buzz than the joy of drinking the wines themselves!I cannot fault anything.

NakedWines	GB	Drinking Naked is strongly recommended!	01 February 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	"We have been drinking Naked (as opposed to naked) for some time and find their selections to be both excellent and ""different"" - because of their investments into smaller (and thus potentially more careful, exacting and exciting) growers/winemakers. Not only are the resulting products good, but there is an added feelgood factor which enhances the experience! Should there ever be a problem with a wine, they have a no quibble attitude which gives real confidence. Strongly recommend to anyone who enjoys their wines and likes to explore different ones (or similar ones from unexpected regions) - they have apparently uniquely close relationships with many suppliers."

NakedWines	GB	I originally purchased from Naked Wines…	01 February 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I originally purchased from Naked Wines a few years ago when I had a discount voucher, and have never regretted it. I have been introduced to so many winemakers who do not normally enter my sphere, i.e. they tend to supply supermarkets which is where i got my wine in the pasr. Yes it is more expensive than the cheaper supermarkets but it tastes so much nicer. I regularly buy wines from certain winemakers who make the wines I prefer. If I found a supermarket wine I liked in the past, the chances were I would not be able to find it again. I can now and I do.

You have access to amazing quality wines that you can not buy in the shops, but at a supermarket price. Add to that no tie in to any contract or minimum quantity you have to consume in a certain timeframe. Include the best customer service which I have personally experienced - I did have an issue just before Christmas, it was not their fault but the delivery company's breaking my wine. However they resolved the issue before I even knew about it. I could go on and on about how much I enjoy their wines, the experience of dealing with their company and supporting independent wines growers, but I'll just say what a pleasure it is and a big shout out to the great people who make Naked Wines what it is.. 😁👍

NakedWines	GB	Scottish review	29 January 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	First of all, the wines and choice are excellent. All have been above my expectations. The advice and support from NW is full and great but never imposing on you. I also like and use the scoring on each wine which is allocated by the NW angels (that's the users) though I have bought lower scored wines just because they appealed and have never been disappointed. Last but definitely not least is that I really feel NW are supporting smaller wine producers and I like that concept.

NakedWines	GB	Duped!!!	28 January 2021	Rated 1 out of 5 stars	I recently took advantage of one of their countless offers i get through the post. I have been a customer of Majestic wines and continue to be happy. The wines that were delivered were part of the 'premium' range so i paid a bit more. They are frankly average and i won't be shopping again. what has really annoyed me however is that they have signed me up to a £20 monthly subscription which i did not agree to. This amount has been deducted from my credit card. The amount has subsequently been refunded and 'membership' cancelled. It seems however it is some sort of deliberate scam and others have similarly been duped. Disgrace.

NakedWines	GB	Buying wine made fun	28 January 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Naked Wines makes choosing and buying wine fun. It's a great experience when new bottles arrive from countries, regions and vineyards each with a story of their desire to produce an honest wine.  The bottle labels have a personal message from the vineyard thanking Naked Wines for helping them distribute their product. You can review the wines and try others that suit your tastes and you gradually find ones that you love.  Because the whole experience is so positive, friendly, speedy and efficient I'm not sure I could go back to buying supermarket wine now!

NakedWines	GB	Naked Wines, service and product how it should be.	28 January 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	"I found Naked Wines 4 or 5 years ago and thought i would give it a go despite usually binning marketing leaflets and offers. Since my 1st order i have found the service to be outstanding as is the wine i have chosen. Recommendations are usually spot on based on what i have bought and reviewed or liked previously. Communications are very good at every stage and the monthly deposit is hardly noticed, and makes buying economical when you have built up a ""war chest"" without really noticing. I have had an issue or two with delivery when they have said i am not in even though i was but that was the courier and not Naked, it has always been rectified within 24 hours though. Hard to fault the whole experience and the wine and other products i have had are excellent."

I've never had any issues at all, in fact when I have had cause to get in touch I have found them to be quick, polite and extremely helpful.If I would like to see anything, it would be just occasionally a free gift to be offered without the proviso of having to spend X amount of money or buy a certain number of bottles. Maybe once a year on the anniversary of membership starting (after say 2 years membership) a credit applied for a gift of up to the value of X amount. That kind of thing. I just think it would be a really lovely thing to do and if only offered after so many months of membership, it would I feel, in the long term, actually be quite cost effective in terms of customer satisfaction and retention.

You can pre order any vintages you particularly enjoy, try new ones and be surprised by wine you haven’t tried, or didn’t particularly enjoy, in my case, rose.   The rose we’ve had in our Naked selection has been delicious.  Full marks Naked

As a member for several years I've enjoyed the variety of wines, spirits and beers on offer plus the free delicious wine of the month, sometimes magnums(!), when ordering 12 bottles of wine. I also enjoy the freedom of making up my own order from what's available or just clicking on a preselected range. I've come to rely on the high standard of everything on offer although a no quibble guarantee is guaranteed (used it once in the 10+ years as a member)! All for £20 a month which I know guess towards helping small sole trader wine makers.

NakedWines	FR	The service provided is excellent	28 January 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	The service provided is excellent. Even when I have made a mistake in ordering, the all important positive attitude from your staff is always there. I also like the very personal way the smaller wine producers are featured so we can see that we are helping the smaller businesses to thrive.One slight disadvantage for me is the fact that I live alone, and I am not a heavy wine drinker, much as I like the wines on offer. It therefore takes me some time to get through a full case of 12 wines.

NakedWines	GB	Good fun and something I'll continue for a while.	27 January 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Joined as I liked the offer they had on a case and have never regretted doing so. I thought that idea of helping diversity in the industry interests me and their method of assisting young folk through university is sound practice for the companies future. The idea of the seeing photos of the vintners and reading something of their lifestyle was a bit twee at first but despite my misgivings I must admit to beginning to enjoy it.. Its been good fun reading other folks reviews of the same wine you are drinking so All in all it gets my vote.

NakedWines	GB	A very different wine company with a sound business ethic for both customers and suppliers.	27 January 2021	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	A good find Naked Wines. On the plus side -1. Naked have a wide range of wines which YOU choose - not someone you don’t know and has no idea of you’re tastes2. Each month they offer free bottles- with a case that you chose to buy.3. They sell wines from handpicked winemakers not normally available in retailers/supermarkets. Wines can be budget prices rising to more pricey fine wines- your choice.4. Any faulty wines or simply one you don’t like will be refunded without quibble. Naked have a good reputation for honesty, good ethics and is interested in its customers and suppliers. There are a lot of of other good comments I could make.Very few negatives-Possibly a bigger focus on the America’s, Australasia and S. Africa. More Europe please in my view.

I love the chance to enjoy new wines and to support winemakers. The range of really fabulous wines is amazing, the prices mean I can mix good, every day gluggables with some extra special bottles, as well as the gems the team add into the box as a wee (usually not so wee) extra!It's also very easy to use the system, a monthly subscription means it adds nicely and doesn't hit my pocket!

NakedWines	GB	You pay for what you get in life	27 January 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	You pay for what you get in life ! We have just received another delicious case of wines from naked wines and are excited about cracking open the first bottle. I have to say this is the first case we’ve ordered since Christmas and have been drinking supermarket wines, please forgive me! In my opinion, there is a very genuine, real and significant difference between a bottle of naked wine and a bottle you buy from your local store. I have missed the quality, depth, taste of their wines and I’m really excited to have my next case. The service I received from naked wines is exemplary and it makes me happy that we are helping to support wine growers across the world !

NakedWines	GB	Excellent customer service	27 January 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	"I have found Naked Wines to be very welcoming and receptive of its customers, which they like to call us ""Angels"".  They have always delivered excellent quality wines and although I have yet to have a bad bottle, will replace free of charge if one does not come up to scratch.  Delivery is prompt and I am always given plenty of notice of arrival date/time.  Apart from once when the notice came after the wine was delivered.  As it was during lockdown, it didn't matter too much as I was in to receive the parcel.  When I complained that i hadn't received notice, I received a free bottle as a goodwill gesture.  I can't speak highly enough about them"

NakedWines	GB	Naked Wines	27 January 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Naked Wines give you the opportunity to access interesting wines that you would not find in the major supermarkets at reasonable prices.Delivery is normally within a couple of working days or frequently the next day. Some cases come delivery free. Putting a small amount in your account by monthly direct debit is doubly useful as you build up your credit over a period of time so no big payment all at one time and this enables you to  become an 'Angel' with extra discounts.A very reliable company.

Wow! Supermarkets etc don’t do that.!!
NakedWines	GB	Naked make  buying much more flexible…	27 January 2021	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	Naked make  buying much more flexible and pleasurable than other wine sellers. Although I am paying a monthly sub I don't feel I am tied in and don't feel obliged to buy when my rack is already full. I enjoy hearing about the new winemakers, the free bottles are a good ploy to get me to buy, and to date I have yet to drink a wine that I have not enjoyed. I have travelled a lot and wine has always featured in those travels but Naked have introduced me to many new wines and regions. The value is also incredible. I particularly enjoy the Christmas case which this year I was too slow to order so missed out! Keep it coming Naked. we need some cheer in these difficult times.

NakedWines	GB	Fed up with dull supermarket wines	27 January 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	"There comes a time when you get more than a little fed up with the wines offered by the local supermarket. At this point you look at trying something a little different. There are several ""wine club"" operators online offering supposedly better quality wine at discount prices. All of these operators attract you in with a ""half price "" baited lure that, once you've taken their poisoned chalice, commits you to a lifetime of similarly bland wines at somewhat inflated prices. Naked wine use similar tactics to interest you but operate in a different way to all the others once you've joined their club. You quickly realise that their wines are actually rather good and their commitment to bringing you wines from small growers from well known wine areas is very important to them. You become known as an ""angel"" and you are invited to ""invest"" a modest sum of money into your account each month with them. Once you have cash in you account you can use it to purchase their wines at decent discount prices, plus if you order a full 12 bottles (mixed or otherwise) from their excellent cellars, you usually get a freebie or two of other wines to enjoy. Look out for their extra special savings at Christmas or when they get a large consignment of quality wines to shift.The really great thing about Naked wines is that they don't pressurize you to buy and they make you feel as if you belong to an exclusive family. You don't need to spend a fortune, many of their wines come in at under a tenner and jolly good they are too !. Of all the operators in the mail order wine field, Naked seem to be the stand out leaders."

NakedWines	GB	Great Experience	27 January 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I saw an advert for Naked Wines on Facebook, and the name intrigued me, so thought it looked a good chance of trying some new wines.  Was impressed with the efficiency of both the ordering and delivery.  I liked the fact that you could give an opinion on each wine and to learn something of where it came from and also that some of the wines came from young wine producers.  I would definitely recommend you buy from Naked Wines for yourself.

I have with Naked Wines, found it difficult to single out one bottle of wine above the other, as my wife and I have enjoyed every bottle. We have even tried grape varieties and blends we would never have chosen before. The excellence of the wines is backed by two other things, customer service and having direct access to the growers.Excellent service, excellent wines, and a darn good price too! Happy days!

There's a wonderful choice, I've never yet been disappointed (OK I've liked some more than others but that would be the case wherever I bought them).

NakedWines	GB	Naked Wines is one of very the few business organisations I admire.	27 January 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Naked Wines is one of very few retailers I hold in high regard; for their interest in and support of small vintners and their financial aid towards charitable projects in South Africa.It's interesting to consider how much better the world would be if all manufacturers and retailers had a moral basis to their undertakings rather than being driven purely by profit.

Not only am I getting great tasting wine, I can review my wines (which helps their recommendations to me), I am supporting small businesses across the world (you get to meet these winemakers and send them messages) and you get treated as an individual by the company, not just a cash card! It’s also nice to give a bottle as a present, that you cannot buy in the shops. Love Naked ♥️

NakedWines	GB	Great initiative and fabulous wines	27 January 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	A reliable supplier of international wines and sparkling champagne. Based on a crowd-funding style approach the Naked Angels (ie participants) join the club by investing in small but ethical and modern winemakers across the globe. In return the Naked Angels get to purchase the product at varying amounts of discount. An effective way to help emerging businesses and directly benefit from it. The quality of their product is by far superior to most supermarket bought merchandise. And with easy to use web site to navigate it is extremely easy to select, research and purchase the wines. Delivery is reliable, prompt and well packaged. Highly recommend.

NakedWines	GB	Naked Wines Review	27 January 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Naked Wines have provided excellent service, keeping purchasers aware of the progress of their order at every stage.  If there has been any issue with the delivery, they inform immediately by text, and when this has happened, particularly during lockdowns, they have credited my account with money, as compensation.  However, the most important aspect of Naked wines is the quality of the wines they provide, and in doing this they support the smaller winemakers throughout the world.  I am also kept aware of what is happening throughout the Naked Wines, wine world, with regular email updates and invites to virtual tasting sessions. They are a first rate, customer friendly organisation, who endeavour to meet the demands of both customer and supplier and do this in a friendly and professional manner.  I would thoroughly recommend them if you are considering having your wine delivered.
NakedWines	GB	All in it together!	27 January 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I have been a member for many years and despite knowing there are many other wine clubs/services, I enjoy the unique and fresh approach that Naked offer. They are always searching for new small growers/producers that provide top quality wine at an honest price BUT they also buy into the company ethos  which I see as, 'business can be fun and remember that you are dealing with xxxxx thousand individual customers who are interested in the provinence of your product and just as importantly, you and your family as the producers'.It makes everyone feel a part of a big wine family!

NakedWines	GB	time server	26 January 2021	Rated 4 out of 5 stars	Been signed up to WA for years, order up a box every few months. Enjoy browsing the wines, and mostly they're good. Some are delicious - they're the ones  out of stock when you re-order. Not madly good value or crazy overpriced, but if you drink lots of wine like me  and are hooked on the supermarket offers, this makes a fun change. Don't bother with anything under a tenner, you'll  do better in Lidl. Admit I was disappointed in my  Christmas treat  'fine wines' case,  but I'm hanging in there, and, yep, Yodl is the let down.
NakedWines	GB	Great experience overall	26 January 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Really good wine at pretty good prices, along with fantastic service. Also if you choose to, a good way to build up an amount of cash to spend on a particular occasion like Christmas, which is what I do.

Comprehensive, helpful descriptions for all wines which help with the little known gems mixed in with the more famous ones. Constantly changing selection means we can't wait for each delivery as we always discover something new we like.I've only ever had one delivery problem which was immediately resolved - you can tell that Naked is more than a business to these people - they actually care.

NakedWines	GB	I'm a Naked Angel 😇  and I LOVE it 💘	26 January 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	"Oh how I LOVE to tell people ""I'm a Naked Angel!"" It certainly gets their attention. I've been a Naked customer for about 4 years. It started out as a Christmas present for my husband. I got a voucher with a very irresistible offer so I tried... and I'm glad I did.I pay £20 a month into my Naked Account. The full amount in my account is mine and I am under no obligation to buy any wines. I usually allow my account to build up to £100 & then order a great case of 12 or 15 wines, with a complimentary bottle thrown in. I just pay any difference. There is great variety of wines to choose from and at a good range of affordable prices. There are even preselected cases to try if you can't decide, or want an introduction. Now the magic of being a Naked Angel is that my money goes towards new or struggling wine makers worldwide. We have rescued businesses through Covid too! They go on to produce fabulous wines for us (with a money back guarantee if you don't like it!) In turn some wine makers support their own communities eg feeding kids in South Africa by providing school dinners.All in all this is one club I love to pay into. I'm not a wine connoisseur but I can rate each wine and over time I receive recommendations based on my taste preferences! It is amazing to even try varieties I've never heard of. I can chat directly with the wine maker and reserve cases of future vintages to receive.I think in all my time I've only had a couple of bottles I didn't quite enjoy. The sales team are very approachable and very helpful.If you enjoy wine, you will not be disappointed."

NakedWines	KH	consistently interesting and delicious wines at a great price	26 January 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Naked Wines saves me the hassle of researching wines because what they send is always delicious! I don't drink that much wine, and a couple of cases a year is more than enough for me including gifts for people. I don't know a lot about wine, but the Naked Wines cases I have had have included some really interesting wines and zero disappointments. For me, it allows me to enjoy really nice wines chosen by someone with a far better palette than me at a really really reasonable price

NakedWines	GB	Good service, good wines. Excellent.	26 January 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	A good selection of good quality wines at good prices, most of which are not available elsewhere. Good personal service, quick delivery, and never any pressure to buy except when you want to.I have some new favourite wines from there, including the best champagne I've ever tasted, at a price well below Bollinger.
NakedWines	GB	Love wine, love Naked!	26 January 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I love Naked wines and have been an “Angel” for three years. The wines are without exception very good and I have tried new regions that would otherwise have escaped me. No pressure to shop I tend to have two or three cases a year and the Christmas hamper. But the choice of what and when is always in my hands. I feel a genuine connection with the wine growers.
NakedWines	GB	This is a fabulous company	26 January 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	This is a fabulous company, doing more than selling fabulous wines, they help so many people both in and out of the industry . I have been a member of the Angels longer than I can remember and wouldn’t get my wine from any where else.Keep up the good work guys , would give you 10 stars ⭐️ if I could. Friendly and helpful staff , would recommend to everyone
NakedWines	GB	Painless Paying	26 January 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	What I like about Naked Wines is that I pay my £25 every month which soon builds up to enough to buy a case.  Then I can treat myself by paying a little bit more when choosing my wines and it doesn't cost me a fortune for a case of superb wines.Deliveries have always been timely and the one time they told me my delivery was delayed they added an extra bottle and the delivery was still on time ;-)
NakedWines	GB	Great choices and lots of insight	26 January 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Great choices and lots of insight. I really enjoy and value my membership- I feel as though it brings me closer to the winemakers whilst offering me a privileged gateway to quality wine and reasonable prices.
NakedWines	GB	Great wine	26 January 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Great wine, great service and easy ordering.
NakedWines	GB	Great wines from small global producers at competitive prices. What’s not to love?	26 January 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	We love the concept of this company in championing small wine producers and We are able to buy delicious high quality wines at competitive prices. The service from the company is excellent and at no time have we felt pressured into buying wines we didn’t want. I have liked the system of paying £20.00 into my account each month because it feels really good to get a case of wine which is already partly paid for. The range of wines on offer is vast and we have tasted wines that we wouldn’t have had access to or frankly the confidence to try. We have drunk wines  out of our comfort zone and we are loving expanding our limited palates. We trust the recommendations from Naked wines and after several cases we haven’t had a wine we haven’t loved.

NakedWines	GB	Naked Angel	26 January 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	I have been a member (Angel) for several years now and I thoroughly recommend Naked Wines. You chose what to put in, the wines are very competitively priced and the quality is very high. I think I have only had two bottles in my entire membership that were off and Naked reunded the full bottle price without hesitation. Many of the winemakers are young and up and coming so members are also helping their business development. Many will converse by mail or on the site, many encourage visitors (post Covid) Join today!
NakedWines	GB	Per ardua ad astra. Ching!	26 January 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	After many disappointments at local supermarkets we decided that untried and untested wine choices were avoidable if we could rely on those with better knowledge at Naked Wines. We tried them and have not looked anywhere else since as the wines supplied are always worthwhile. I love being an Angel and feel I am helping wine-makers as well as being on the receiving end of luscious bottles. Thank you. You are the best.

NakedWines	GB	It's not a club, but a community!	26 January 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Here is where you'll find not only great wines, but a helpful community of fellow wine drinkers without any of the snobbery.I love the open and honest reviews from fellow angels that help you choose from a wide selection of the wines available from small scale producers.The way naked wines fund these small scale producers is fairly unique as far as I know, and is an excellent way to save for all those scrummy wines.
NakedWines	GB	Not a Gimmick	26 January 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	When I initially signed up, I thought NW could be a gimmick based upon that initial selection; how wrong could I be!Whilst the available wines near no resemblance to what you’d get in a supermarket, the explanations and guidance makes choices a lot easier. You can search by country, grape, and colour, and ordering delivers exactly as advertised. Prices suit all budgets with no pressure to place an order. We’re very satisfied and enjoy searching through the wines that suit our palate.Thank you
NakedWines	GB	Consistently EXCELLENT!	26 January 2021	Rated 5 out of 5 stars	Consistently good product - be it wine, spirit or cider - never had anything we didn't like and many that we've raved about. Delivery always fast and efficient. Competitive on price. Even the advertising is informative and not overly intrusive. So what's there not to like? Frankly - NOTHING!
